"3.0" "First of all my friend took me here so I wasn't excited. I don't think any living animal or fish should be confined for humans entertainment. But I went as a compromise and expected it would be a nice place. Soooo if you like paying $17 to park (that's if you get your ticket validated) and $40 to walk around in a place so packed that you can't see anything and so hot that your body pours sweat then go. You can feel just as miserable as all the ocean life trapped there." "9/9/2015"
"3.0" "The National Aquarium is definitely a great thing to see if you're visiting Baltimore with children and it's great for a rainy day, but it's definitely not the best aquarium I've ever been to and it's very expensive, even at the discounted \"Friday late night\" price. The new black tip reef shark exhibit is really great and it's clear a lot of time and energy went into creating it. That is definitely worth spending a large amount of time exploring while there. However, the remaining exhibits weren't really anything special. I really found myself consistently hoping for more detailed information on some of the fish and it would have been great if they could utilize technology more frequently throughout the exhibit through touch screens or QR codes.If you do decide to explore the aquarium, I HIGHLY recommend talking to the employees walking through the exhibits. Each employee we talked to was enthusiastic, knowledgable, and very nice. They really added to the exhibits and are definitely the aquariums best resource." "11/26/2014"
"5.0" "I'll say this. Based on the smile my 10 month old had on his face the whole time because he loves seeing big fishies, it was worth it. But for me personally, the whole experience was only fun for 45 minutes. I don't think the amount of entertainment I got from here was worth $70 in tickets on a Tuesday afternoon. But you're paying for the location, the upkeep of the place, and I get that. It's just not my bag. I had more fun watching my son than the exhibits. Also, I understand why the place makes you check your stroller at the front. It's not stroller friendly. But that doesn't help the experience. Next time I'll go to the zoo. It's cheaper and they have fish there too. Plus they allow strollers." "9/9/2014"
"4.0" "We had an amazing day here at the Aquarium. It wasn't too crowded and we got to spend as much time as we wanted at each exhibit. There was so much to see it was well worth the money. We arrive at 130pm and didn't leave until 5pm, and only because the little ones were worn out and we were worn out from carrying them lol. I only thing that could make it better is if they had a area were we could pet or touch the sea life....I would just love it. This aquarium was awesome and we will be returning. Maybe this time on Friday night." "12/13/2014"
"4.0" "This is a nice aquarium for the area. I am sure there are better in the United States but this is a nice one. I went on the weekday so it wasn't at all crowded.   They have many nice colorful fish and sharks and even Dolphins. I felt bad for the Dolphins because they are much to smart to be living in a small enclosure. Watch The Cove and you will understand my feelings. But They were still nice to look at.   It took us two hours to walk the entire thing and we saw everything. Everything was open to us and it is 35.00 per adult. Not the cheapest but it was worth it.  The only negative was the rainforest. Too hot and muggy and it smelled bad. Plus nothing really to see there. Some parrots , and tarantulas in wooden glass encased logs. Which really you wouldn't even notice unless you are an observant person. I am.   Go check it out! There are plenty of places to eat right around it. Chain restaurants and you have Little Italy right across the street. Just make sure to check out Yelp reviews for where to eat in Little Italy. The good places are further within the neighborhood. Don't walk into the very first place you see." "3/27/2015"
"2.0" "I've finally made the time to come down to Baltimore to go to this aquarium and I was not disappointed. It's a great place for family trips but it could even be a nice place for a date. The highlight of the aquarium is definitely the Atlantic exhibit (forgot what the actual name is). Theres a dolphin exhibit where you can see the dolphins swim around in a big tank. Unfortunately, there wasn't a dolphin show on the day that we went. There's also a safari exhibit that makes you feel like you're in a huge greenhouse. It was very humid in there but saw a couple monkeys. Overall it's a wonderful experience. I would buy tickets in advanced so you don't have to wait. The tickets has a specific entry time so you won't be able to enter the aquarium until at or after the time on your ticket." "1/3/2015"
"5.0" "Just watch as you walk into this aquarium...every child, grandma, parent, and weird uncle has a camera or smart phone in their hand. What's worse is the realization that as you wander through the fascinating maze of beautiful exhibits and encapsulated nature - EVERYONE IS TAKING A f!/@;?#¥ picture with every device possible, in every angle, and in every crack and crevice of this God-forsaken place. It is the worst aquarium experiences that I've had in a very long time. The last time I was in an aquarium, I was at the Monterey Bay Aquarium back home. People were respectful, children were eager to learn, and everyone was there to be engaged with the wonders of nature. I guess it may be the climate here in the East Coast, but everywhere we went, someone was taking a selfie or blocking my view of the exhibits with their massive Samsung Galaxy. What a disappointment.What is actually more disappointing though, is that the aquarium management have modeled this place for profit generation, rather than a venue for education. They really need to put more \"no photos\" signs on the walls and exhibits, because I find it impossible that the organisms displayed here are not distracted / affected by the constant flashes of everyone's iPhones. I also noticed how overcrowded some of the exhibits were. This is insane!! No thanks, I'll stick to my west coast aquariums, where they care more about the animal's well-being rather than the money they make from technology-dependent tourists. I sound like a tree-hugger...oh well. It's ok to judge me. Because I've already judged you!" "8/8/2014"
"5.0" "This review is coming from someone who is not passionate about aquatic life and does not know much about the topic: THE NATIONAL AQUARIUM IS A FANTASTIC PLACE TO VISIT.Sunday afternoon, Inner Harbor, cold weather, relatively busy. Purchasing tickets was a piece of cake as there were no lines. We walked in relatively quickly just in time for the 4-D Seamonsters (a relatively short movie on prehistoric aquatic creatures in 4-D). The show is a must! It was very well done, for ages 4 and up I believe (there were quite a few smaller children that were horrified by the whole thing!) with interesting facts and images. After the show we started walking around the museum and just followed the path of the escalators. The space is designed brilliantly with sections all inter-connected and relevant to each other. Beautiful fish and aquatic creatures of all shapes and sizes. The whole thing is mesmerizing. One can spend hours looking at the coral reef and all the beautiful fish swimming so peacefully in it. Going to the higher floors, visitors can still glance down and see the reef from above. It gets even better when one makes one's way all the way down to see the reef from below. The jelly fish invasion was another small exhibition that was very beautiful and worth the visit. I had always heard great things about the National Aquarium and I am so happy I finally got a chance to visit it. For us Washingtonians that are used to paying $0 for some of the most amazing museums or the National Zoo, paying $35 can seem a bit steep but I think it was well worth it (note that the 4-D movie is an additional $5/adult)." "3/30/2015"
"3.0" "I've been to the Baltimore aquarium several times and I'm always blown away.  There are so many things to do and see at this aquarium; my favorite exhibit is the jellyfish tanks. They are just so mysteriously beautiful, I cant stop watching them float around!Tickets are $25 to get in, which is pretty pricey, but so worth it! An aquarium visit is wayyy more memorable than going out to dinner or something. Your family with appreciate and cherish it way more. I think they offer discounted pricing after 5pm on Fridays.The staff is truly amazing. They're so knowledgeable and genuinely energetic. They want you to have a great experience and learn as much as you can during your visit." "2/23/2015"
"5.0" "Even though it seemed pretty pricey to me, this is the best aquarium I've ever been to. If I went back, I'd try to go on a weekend. Super crowded and tons of wild kids running around. The shark tanks are so awesome and the dolphin discovery reminded me of Sea World!" "7/19/2015"
"5.0" "Came with the 9 year old and sprang for the \"Shark Encounter\" ($50 ish per person vs. $35 ish for a regular admission) and worth every cent of the extra $15.If we lived in Baltimore we would become members for sure!Al (our long-time tour guide) has been wit the Aquarium for 33 years and is a gem!  He also is a biology professor.  We learned so much in a 2 hour tour!And the crowd avoidance tactics he used on a Busy Sunday were PRICELESS.Love this place so much!Try to come on a Tuesday AM or after 3 PM.Also special deals on Friday nights." "8/27/2014"
"2.0" "The National Aquarium already has more than 300 reviews, but I will try to offer a somewhat unique perspective as someone who attended a rehearsal dinner for a wedding here. If you're considering this for a special dinner, engagement party, or even wedding itself, it really does make for a unique occasion. The entire aquarium was rented out at night and the 150 guests were free to meander around the entire aquarium with cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. The guests were given the gift of seeing everything up close without hordes of families, screaming toddlers, and tons of tourists taking selfies in front of the shark tank. Though I'm not really a fan of zoos and aquariums (seeing such wild animals in confined spaces makes me sad) it really was amazing to have such unparalleled access. And it's shocking how little there is separating you from the sharks. It would be very easy to just drop your phone, camera, or whatever right over the edge! I especially enjoyed seeing the baby puffins....so adorable!It was almost eery wandering down the shark ramp at night with literally no one else around, and an experience I'll never forget. Highly recommended for special events...probably best not to serve sushi though :/" "12/28/2013"
"5.0" "Given the very steep price, this museum seems dated and surprisingly small. It pales in comparison to Boston, Monterey etc. The layout is odd with tons of unused square footage, which from the outside makes the place look much much larger than it is. Jellyfish room was very compelling but save your money and have a nice crab dinner. Good museums are worth the money. Not this one." "9/1/2015"
"4.0" "Awesome awesome awesome! !! We had the best time! 3 adults and a 4 year old.  All the exibits were clean beautiful and inviting. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  The whole experience blew us away! The cafe was nice but super pricey.We will visit again but eat elsewhere. Sad that for some reason they discontinued the dolphins show. Does anyone know why? They seemed horribly bored.We were very impressed with the staff and the animals. Definitely go if you have a day, you will love it. We walked in and immediately a staff member was feeding the sting rays and larger fish. He didn't mind answering questions and giving information.  Really stellar experience!  Staff walking around was so nice and talkative. All of the animals looked at ease, healthy and happy.  We loved the mixed animals in the exhibits." "7/19/2014"
"4.0" "We didnt get to see the shows, but the exhibits were awesome! So many fish and sharks, the jellyfish exhibit was beautiful. So many jellies, and adorable fish. Ugly fish, too! Turtles, snakes, ugh I was all over taking a ton of pictures. We loved it; wish some tanks were bigger, way too many people to actually get to see some of them." "1/5/2014"
"4.0" "Visited this Aquarium early on a Saturday with a few other adults. There is a great variety of fish, frogs, snakes, etc throughout the Aquarium. There is a huge pool of fish, sharks and turtles that you can see from almost every room in the place. We watched a short Dolphin feeding where they explained how the trainers work with Dolphins. It wasn't a show where they do tricks which was okay, I've seen that before. A friend who took his son later in the afternoon said it was a little big for the five year old who just wanted to run around. If you see everything properly, it takes about 2 hours to go through. Small children may get bored. I would recommend buying tickets online and going early. That helps avoid crowds. We really enjoyed our time at the Aquarium, it is one of the best i've been to. Don't miss the sloth in the Amazon!" "7/13/2015"
"3.0" "I have never been to an aquarium so literally, everything was so magical to me when I went. It is a perfect place in Baltimore for a date or just bringing your children to. There are plenty of other tourist attraction near the aquarium for a fun-filled day of attractions. The price was roughly about $19 per person. The only sad part about my visit to the aquarium was that there was no dolphin show :(" "8/4/2014"
"5.0" "After paying $27 for parking on a SUNDAY, I was already expecting to see some bizarrely high prices in Baltimore.  Well, the aquarium cost $35 to get into, and what separated it from the other aquariums I've enjoyed (Vancouver and Boston)?  Puffins.  That's about it.  It turns out there's only so many kinds of animals you can put in your aquarium.  If you've enjoyed those other aquariums, this one will not add much new.  It also made me weary of my own city's (Albany) dreams of putting an aquarium near the river.  We might be at Peak Aquarium, especially in the northeast with the Boston aquarium so darn close.But I can't give it a bad review simply because I've seen a sea turtle before. It's a big aquarium, with lot of different creatures, and knowledgeable presenters.  I especially liked the dolphin presentation.  There are no set times for dolphin shows, you just show up and you'll end up seeing something.  We saw the trainers working with and training their dolphins.  They've got an octopus, puffins, flying foxes (huge bats), sloths, sharks, so, you know... Good for kids and animal lovers.  It suffers from the same problems of annoying children as any aquarium.  This might seem like a weird complaint, but I found the building really poorly laid out.  There is a lot of infrastructure based on people-moving (stairs, hallways, moving sidewalks) and sometimes little direction, especially upon entrance.  The absolute worst is the main hall, which is criss-crossed by escalators.  They went through all the trouble of hanging a whale skeleton, and then you can never get a clear view of it because there are escalators in the way.  Boston's aquarium has a simple corkscrew ramp that wraps the largest tank as a way of moving people up and downstairs.One point off for price, another point off for the layout." "6/23/2014"

"3.0" "We visited there yesterday, and had a very mixed experience. We were a party of 5 including a wheelchair. When we approached the ticket line outside, we were almost immediately directed to the accessible area to purchase our tickets and gain entry. Once inside, we asked about the route we should take, considering we had a wheelchair and we saw that each level is accessed by escalator. Our directions were to take the elevator to each floor, and follow the blue wall back to the elevator.Well, the elevators open up on each floor in the middle of each floor, so you are constantly going against the flow of traffic to see half of the exhibits, and then doubling back to get back to the elevator, and it is dark so you can't make out any blue walls.While in the Australian exhibit, the path is very narrow and there was no way we could follow it against the flow of people. We were approached by a guide  and our troubles were answered! Her name was Marty. She realized there was no way for us to fight the traffic, so she had us step over to the side, and proceeded to point out things we would have missed, and stories about them we would have never known. Like how their scientists go around hand pollinating the cocoa trees so we can see the pods form and how they got their sloths and that there is a favorite who was born there whom they will never give away. Also how they are participating in saving them from extinction since the rain forests are being destroyed. We felt like we were on a private tour, and learned many interesting facts I'm not sure we would have learned on our own, even though she was with us for less than 15 minutes.Over all, we had a great time! I just wish there was more thought into how a person views the exhibits from a wheelchair. Since most of the levels are slightly dark, it can very quickly become a safety issue fighting your way against the flow on a busy day." "7/12/2015"
"4.0" "Disclaimer: I LOVE THE AQUARIUM.However, I am reluctant to give this aquarium five stars. For one, its hella expensive, coming in at $35 for an adult admission ticket. Secondly, I don't think that the exhibits that they have warrant such an expensive admissions price.While I loved the huge tank they had which displayed all different kinds of fish and marine life, I found it a little disappointing, especially when compared to the aquarium in Boston. I really liked the different sharks they had, and the octopus exhibit as well. I think they should get a second octopus for their exhibit though, since I heard that most octopuses in captivity die of depression and loneliness. After going to the Aquarium of the Pacific, I was HIGHLY disappointed with their jellyfish display. Most of the jellyfish looked damaged and the number of jellyfish they had in their exhibit was sparse. Not cool.TL;DR - not worth the price." "7/8/2014"
"4.0" "Pretty cool... won't repeat what others have said, but a few things to note:Kids under 3 are free.  I brought a pair of two year olds- they L-O-V-E-D it.We went on a Friday during the day, and it wasn't very crowded.The food isn't half bad, but in retrospect I still would have preferred the value of the Chipotle across the way from the aquarium vs. my $9 burger.The penguins are amazing.  Little birds flying underwater.There are bats in the Australia exhibit.  Luckily they don't come down to the floor much, according to the lovely guide that chatted with us on our visit.Worth the trip!"

All staff were very knowledgeable and very friendly, You can find Sharks, Dolphins, Octopus, Jelly Fish and many many many more.... It was my second time to visit here and will come back again if I have more money and time!" "1/19/2015"
"4.0" "Visting from Maine, on vacation. We went during the discount ticket times displayed on the website. We really should have just spent the extra money however and made a day of it. We didn't have enough time to tour the whole aquarium. There were lots of exhibits, lots of sea creatures, this place was LARGE. I loved the multi-level dolphin pool. There was a very cool jungle-ish section as well. I should have collected a map of the facility upon entering for better time management. The kids loved it. The photos at the door are extremely over priced but if you have that sort of money to waste, it's a good momento to have. The location is great as well. Love the Inner Harbor.  I look forward to returning to this aquarium the next time we are in the area." "2/1/2015"
"3.0" "My husband and I had a great time at the National Aquarium.I heard someone mention that the price of the ticket was high - we did not agree.  Many places will charge you an entrance fee and then more fees along the way for extra exhibits, but the National Aquarium did not.  For about $35 each, we got an afternoon of education, entertainment, a dolphin show, and to see everything we wanted.  Plus we felt confident that the fee would go towards supporting a good cause/place.It was very clear that the museum takes very good care of its animals.  The tanks all looked great, and so did the fish inside.  Lots of variety, and plenty of really cool exhibits (the sharks, dolphins, and jellyfish were particularly awesome).  Sometimes it was hard to see anything over/through the hordes of people and kids standing in front of each tank; I'm not sure how they could really do that better since it's more of a people/courtesy issue than then aquarium's problem.Great for kids and adults alike!" "4/6/2015"
"3.0" "I recommend attending the aquarium during non-peak hours. Early morning during the week seems to be a great time in terms of small crowds. The aquarium is a unique place, but not unique enough to justify the expense in my opinion.   I took my two year old daughter who receives free admission, but after my admission, parking, and a very small bite to eat at the cafe I still spent $70.  I could see how this would be a hit with older kids who may be interested in science and perhaps sharks etc., but for a two year old a \"fishy\" is a \"fishy\" and the local pet store would have done the trick (my fault). It is also very dark in many areas which isn't something my daughter loved. Not sure when they stopped the dolphin shows and I  assume this was due to pressure from animal rights groups, but the \"dolphin experience\" they advertise is misleading.  There isn't much to it, 6-8 dolphins swimming around in a big tank.  I think you will get a better experience watching a movie about dolphins on the Discovery Channel.   Overall we had fun, but not worth it for young children." "1/28/2015"
"5.0" "I don't think I've been to an actual aquarium. Only been to like zoos and sea world. So I felt a little unimpressed. Don't get me wrong the selection of animals they have is great! But the price for admission to see these animals were definitely too expensive. And may not be worth it. I really like the sharks and the frogs and toads. Oh and the octopus! The jellyfish exhibit was also great.I've read a few reviews before going and heard that the aquarium discontinued the dolphin show. When I went, it seemed like they did, but they have the dolphins in the tank playing. It was very cute. Even though they don't have a show anymore, you still get to see them.The layout of the aquarium is pretty simple and straight forward. The main exhibits are connected as you go up the escalators. There are some other exhibits on the other side of the aquarium as well. There is quite a bit to explore. About 2-3 hours. And I really like their water bottle refill stations.This is definitely a one time visit for me." "6/30/2014"
"5.0" "A must see for locals and tourists! From the newly renovated black tip reef, to the rainforest, to the dolphin encounter it's simply amazing! For locals the membership pays for itself in less than 2 visits and has benefits like: automatic entry even when there are long waits for the public, discounts in gift shops, and endless visits. There are no longer dolphin shows as of 2012. I was initially disappointed in this, but when we found out it is because the new leadership wants to focus more on conservation than exploiting the dolphins we were impressed. They still feed the dolphins and have chats regularly (this still includes tricks, etc.). If possible avoid weekends unless you can arrive early or late. We like to park in Little Italy. The flat rates are less than $10 and are a short walk. Lastly, a touch exhibit opens in May of 2015 and we are pretty jazzed about it! Visit the aquarium today!" "12/28/2014"
"3.0" "My favorite aquarium!  A must see!  The care the animals get is above and beyond exceptional and it shows.  It is pricey but it all goes back into the exhibits and animals.  Plus it is so relaxing to just watch the sharks." "6/30/2015"
"5.0" "I've been here twice - first time for an orchestra trip in 9th grade and again this past summer - and wow, prices sure have hiked up in six years. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that ticket prices were $35 (pretty pricey IMO!) I think I would've enjoyed it more. And forget about eating at the cafe...talk about overpriced food.My friends and I figured we needed to spend at least five hours in order to make our money's worth. We went through each exhibit slowly and hung around the gift shop for at least 40 minutes. (We were really intent on making it worth the $35.) I think I would've enjoyed it more had there been more interesting exhibits and animals. There were a lot of fish (no duh) but I was really hoping for more penguins (there was only one) or seal lions (none) or turtles (i recall a few). I think I'm a bigger fan of the zoo because there are more animals and exhibits, but otherwise it was a decently enjoyable experience.Would I come here again? Probably not in the near future."

"5.0" "This is the most mystical places that you can step into. There are beautiful sea animals surrounding you as you roam through the whole aquarium. Sea creatures are in exquisite environments that makes you feel like you really plunged into the ocean or the coral reef!  I really enjoy that they focus on educating students and adults about the importance of preserving our Earth in order to help take care of all these beautiful animals. They have staff members throughout the aquarium telling people about different things. One of the staff members showed kids a cockroach, that you can find in the rainforest, and told the students that they were nature's natural recyclers! There is a entertaining and educational dolphin show! They have dolphins do tricks like flips and jumps. Watch out for the seat where it is marked the splashed zone because you will be splashed by the dolphins! Hahaha. As the show is going on, a spokes person tells you information about dolphins! Uhhh... and I learned a lot from it (even at the age of 25)! Did you know dolphins are still conscious as they sleep and scientist have found that they shut down only half of their brain when they doze off! So cool! There are lots of exhibits throughout the aquarium and it is definitely an activity that you can do all day and have so much fun doing it (and learn so much from it too). Take your children here and show them this awesome place!" "1/16/2015"

"3.0" "Ooooh National Aquarium... where do I begin?! Well to start get your tickets online... that saves you time standing in the ticket line. But they have many many more lines waiting for you. A line to get in... a line for exhibits. Oh the crowds. Urgh. Avoid peak hours.. even though the price is the same i.e. 12 vs after 3pm \"super side eye\" The shark exhibit was good but really dark. Confused my kid with another of the same height... weight etc. D'oh. Took the accessible exit/stairs (there was a sign)to avoid the crowds... ended up walking past ofc space and aquarium workers.... oopsie! 2 dophins in the dophin exhibit. Rain forest exhibit was fun. tamarin monkeys were out. In the end,  my sons were ready to go. My oldest son said \"ma, I'm done\" I should have said this earlier... but we've visited aquariums in other states i.e. SC. They never asked to leave!

NA "I recently moved to DC, and we decided to do a day trip to the National Aquarium. I had been there when I was younger, and I remembered it being interesting and fun, so I was excited to go back again. We went on a Monday holiday- I think Veteran's Day.We bought timed tickets online for $36.90 each. The tickets are for a specific date and time time (ex. 11:15am on a specific date). You can also buy tickets at the aquarium, but supposedly, they sometimes fill up and you may not be able to enter right away, or they might be sold out for the day if it is busy. We parked in a garage down the street, and parking was about $15-20 for the day. There may be cheaper options in the area, but we didn't look. The aquarium was somewhat busy, but not packed. It took us about an hour or two to go through the whole aquarium (although my friends liked to speed through exhibits, and not take the time to read all the information). We also swung by the dolphin show, which I enjoyed. I was disappointed that they didn't have penguins (although they did have puffins), and my friend was disappointed they didn't have manatees (random, I know). But overall, it was one of the better aquariums I've been to, and it had enough to be fun for a wide range of ages (i.e. both adults and kids). I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon because the tickets are so expensive, but I'm definitely glad I went once!" "12/27/2013"
