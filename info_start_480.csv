"1" "3.0" "I love this aquarium.  I've been coming here with my family since I was little, and I visited last weekend with my boyfriend.  The price for admission, the dolphin show and the 4D show was $30 each, which is a little pricey, but it's definitely a high quality place.  I particularly love the shark exhibit, but all of the exhibits are great and well set-up.  The flow is really great, too, and you feel like you move logistically throughout the place without missing anything.  I love the dolphin show - the tricks are so cute and it's pretty lengthy, so you feel like you're getting your money's worth.  I also liked the 4D show, which was a part of the planet Earth film, with some special effects thrown in.  I like the planet Earth series a lot, it's just really inspiring to see.  The gift shops have some cute items for sale, especially their stuffed animals.  There's also a cafeteria with the normal food, but I felt like we'd do better eating in one of the Harbor's many restaurants.  It's definitely a great experience, and you will be occupied for at least three hours if you see everything.  I have been numerous times and it never gets old." "10/21/2011"
"2" "4.0" "The last time I went to the Baltimore Aquarium I was just a wee lass and remember it being quite impressive.  We went last night for Fridays After 5, but unfortunately, everyone else went too.  I am giving it 3 stars because it was just too damn crowded in there and it was hard to just relax and see the aquariums.  This is my recommendation - go to Fridays After 5 at 7:55 pm.  It closes at 9:30 but last entry is at 8:00.  It isn't very clear on the website so most people think it closes at 8 and come way earlier.  I think you could be in there pretty much by yourself if you went at 8 pm.  So go have a nice dinner and then head to the Aquarium after!" "9/11/2010"
"3" "5.0" "Here's another place in Baltimore that I never tire of. Our family goes no less than twice of year and my daughter loves the dolphin show. The aquarium has very good special exhibitions and does a good job of teaching about conservation and the environment through interactive displays.  The jellyfish invasion was super cool as was the polar express 4-d film.  It's a bit pricey for a family of four, but If you can go on a Friday after five during certain months, you can get in deeply discounted. As tempting as it might be, avoid $1 days where it gets so crowded that it is not enjoyable." "12/5/2010"
"4" "2.0" "So you want to learn about sea base animals. Or, do you want your kids to go \"Hey NEMO, are you okay???\". Or just take an afternoon and do something different. Well, here is the place to do all of the above. Very nice aquarium that also includes other exhibits such as the rain forest and Australian terrain. And the shark tank is super cool. Be sure to take your time when going, the place is very big and will take some time to see it all. Specially if you want to really see everything and every show." "2/9/2009"
"5" "4.0" "The tickets were super expensive and all of the exhibits were crowded. Everyone we talked to said this was the best aquarium that have been to. It is good, but not as good as Boston's.The fish tank thing that surrounds you is kind of cool, but not worth the $20+ ticket price. Also there were so many inconsiderate mothers who would use there strollers to either mow you down or block the entire exhibit that you only go to see the exhibits from a far because your life was in jeopardy." "12/26/2007"
"6" "2.0" "Just visited the National Aquarium in Baltimore. What a great time we had! Just about every exhibit we went to we were greeted by friendly staff who seemed genuinely enthused about being there and seeing all the kids so overjoyed by the experience. It was really thrilling for our 2 year old and her friend. Though we didn't make it to the dolphin show, we covered pretty much the whole place in about 2 hours (we were taking our time). It was really an awesome day. The food is obviously overpriced, so we opted to eat across the street at Potbelly's, definitely a good call. Lots of people complain about how much it costs to get into the aquarium, but kids under 3 get in for free and I'd say it was worth the $24.95 per adult, no question. I could think of a lot lamer ways to spend 25 bucks! Oh, favorite exhibit of the day, SHARKS, no doubt. The kids were blown away walking down the windy ramp as the sharks zoomed by. Definitely looking forward to heading back to the National Aquarium soon." "1/7/2012"
"7" "1.0" "The National Aquarium in Baltimore:The Baltimore Aquarium is in need of some serious updating. There are only three exhibits worth mentioning: the ray pool, the shark tank, and the jellyfish room.The remaining space is filler - mood lighting, extended moving walkways, and home-sized fish tanks featuring one or two slumbering amphibians apiece - all designed to corral your kiddies into the innumerable gift shops. There are more ocean themed gimcrackeries here than fish: Halloween shark masks, pink plushy seals, snow-globe dolphin picture frames, sparkly logo coffee mugs, and mermaid princess dress-ups. It seems more like a Chinese shopping mall, which happens to have a few decorative tanks of live fish on display, than a world-class aquarium.If your kiddie is an über manta ray or shark fanatic, then the Baltimore Aquarium might be worth a visit; otherwise, I would recommend skipping it.Two Stars.__________________________________________________­_______The Dolphin Show:The dolphin show consisted of five trainers stuffing the faces of a handful of overindulged dolphins with dead fish. There were two jumbotron monitors, both playing a mind-numbingly dull pseudo-environmentalist video between feedings. Throughout the show, the spoiled dolphins ignored their trainer's commands, preferring to paddle around the pool as they pleased, tossing their toys in the air higgledy-piggledy, and, on occasion, slapping their flippers in defiance. One naughty dolphin, which was cordoned off in a holding tank behind the main pool, leapt into the air a few times in a vain plea for attention. The commentator continued to read her mawkish lines in a stupefying monotone - they consisted of such enlightening trivia as, \"dolphins are similar to us because they have teeth.\" A volunteer gamely displayed her own teeth - the dolphin was not so obliging. Three other kiddies from the audience nervously waved a random assortment of international flaps in a spotlighted corner to highlight \"our celebration of dolphins.\" Shifting around our seats like squirmy children, my companion and I continued to wait in anticipation for the dolphin show to begin (synchronized leaps, vigorous flipper splashing, and blowhole squeaks and whistles!); but, that was it, that was the entire program: bratty dolphins being fed too much fish. Zero Stars (well, save for that one naughty dolphin - we liked him)." "1/12/2011"
"8" "4.0" "If I could give this a zero star rating I would. The wait time to get in was over an hour so we went to dicks last resort for an early lunch. We got back to the aquarium 30 minutes before our ticket entrance time and had to stand and wait 15 more minutes just to get in. Where is the value for $30 per person??????? We spent more time walking from exhibit area to exhibit area than looking at the mini exhibits they had. This place is a rip off and you would be better served going to shedd in Chicago or even the Wilmington aquarium in NC. Save your $ -- especially considering the nearest parking garage two blocks away was $24 for over three hours of parking! Rip off!!!" "2/25/2011"
"9" "1.0" "This is a very cool place to visit! It's on the pricey side, so look out for specials like $5 Fridays after 5 (aqua.org/discounts.html). Buy your tickets online, it's a huge timesaver. The 4D movie is worth the extra money I had a blast in there! Skip the dolphin show and rent The Cove for insight into what a cruel practice this is." "11/17/2010"
"10" "4.0" "Awful! Way too crowded. They herd everybody down dark hallways to see animals crammed in tiny living quarters with little stimulation. In most cases, there was 4 people deep at every display.  The written info is so small you can't even read it. Way too expensive!  What a mistake." "4/8/2012"
"11" "5.0" "I had visited this aquarium about 15 years ago and remembered it fondly, but wasn't sure what to expect after all these years and visits to numerous other aquariums around the country and world. I read through many of the fellow Yelpers' recommendations to get an idea of what was in store and help plan the rest of our time in Baltimore. This proved to be very helpful. We went on a Saturday in August and our group consisted of 4 adults and 1 four year old. I bought the tickets online, which saved us a lot of time waiting in line, so were worth the extra ~$1.50 fee. The tickets were about $26, with a whole $1 discount for Seniors! (I think the price was fair for what the aquarium offered.) Plus, since i picked the time, i knew exactly when we would get in. (this helped plan our day, but you cannot change ticket times when you get there, so put a little thought into it). Our entrance time was 1pm, and we were in within a few minutes of that time, which was nice. We were let in with about 50 other people, so to some extent you're moving along with these same people for at least the first part of the aquarium, which makes it hard to see the exhibits at your own pace, especially with kids. We found the rest of the aquarium to also be somewhat crowded. The large crowds also make it hotter, but the cool aquarium was much better than the hot and sticky weather outside. We skipped the dolphin and 4D show as many advised, and it worked out well. (You can still see the dolphins swimming around in their tank, even if you don't watch the show) We were in the aquarium from about 1-3:30, which included seeing the jellyfish exhibit (about a 10 min wait to see) and a 15 min stop at the gift shop at the end. It was hard to really spend the time reading all the plaques and pictures with the large crowd always moving around you, taking pictures, etc. Id suggest an off time/season/day if you really want to take your time. Most of the exhibits were good, as expected, although i remembered there being more from my childhood. (i think everything just seemed bigger and better back then!) The jellyfish exhibit was a little disappointing and small, especially after waiting in a somewhat crowded line for about 10min. We moved through that exhibit fairly quick, approx 15min. The sharks were fun to see, with a number of them swimming around in a large tank, with the visitors' pathway weaving around it. The large central pool housed rays, sea turtles and large fish, and it you timed it right, you could watch the aquarium divers feed them. This aquarium was a good visit and is close enough (approx 2 hrs) to do again another weekend, but maybe not for another year or two. We're going to visit the children's museum next." "9/10/2009"
"12" "5.0" "The shark tanks are amazing. The dolphin show is fun. The tropical fish are beautiful. It's a fantastic experience." "1/5/2010"
"13" "2.0" "I can't even tell you how much I love the Baltimore Aquarium!!!  I can spend all day, every day there - I can never see the same shark swim around the tub too many times!  And the Jelly Invasion...how do they catch those things?  I am a big fan of the jellies too, clearly!  I might even have to put up an embarrassing picture of me running around the aquarium in a shark mask...if you haven't been, you need to visit he Aquarium!!" "11/16/2010"
"14" "2.0" "I'd give it three stars, but I think that $25 a pop is overpriced.  It was good - a nice little walk around seeing the fish, sharks, octopus, etc. - but the place honestly seemed a bit minimalist to me.  The centerpiece of the aquarium is the ray tank, and it's literally that - a big tank with nothing in it but rays (and small sharks and the cool one-flippered sea turtle).  Same thing with the shark tank.  I just think some other aquariums I've gone to are better - it's been a while, but Philadelphia, Boston and Chicago rank higher in my mind.  And for $13 I honestly enjoyed the much smaller NYC aquarium more.The whole rainforest part of this aquarium was pretty weak... there were about 100 people for every bird.  And even then the birds weren't all that interesting...It's probably a nice aquarium if you live close and want to swing by for the day, but I wouldn't go out of my way again to visit." "11/1/2010"
"15" "3.0" "Not a fan. The aquarium is overpriced and overcrowded in the summer. Count on timed entries--and even then, you'll be waiting in lines to see things inside. If I had to choose highlights, I'd say the Australia exhibit is ok, and the three-finned sea turtle and huge stingrays are all right. The building and exhibits feel outdated, heavy, and claustrophobic, and the animal welfare activist in me cringes at the idea of a dolphin show. (I skipped it when I visited.) The shark exhibit is sad--just a bunch of large sharks in a small enclosure, swimming perpetually in circles. Visit the National Zoo's reptile/invertebrate/Amazonia houses for better exhibits at no cost." "7/6/2007"
"16" "4.0" "It's worth visiting at least once. Kind of an expensive outing though unless you can get specials." "11/12/2010"
"17" "2.0" "The dolphin show was great and they had a wide variety of creatures / educational facts! Safe and fun place for a family outing! However if you'd like to avoid all the screaming kids, try going around 3 - 5 pm. Parking wasn't easy or cheap but it was worth the time you'll spend at the aquarium and the surrounding area!" "2/21/2012"
"18" "5.0" "Maybe it's because I come from a spot that houses the new Academy of Sciences in SF or Monterey Bay Aquarium but I was really not impressed by the National Aquarium.  There was a lot of \"Oh, we have that,\" \"and that,\" \"and that!\"  The dolphin show was sub-par and the 4-D show was pretty cool but it was like 7 minutes!!  I honestly didn't believe it was over and was waiting for the lights to shut off again.  Good for kids, good for field trips, but the aquariums from home are much better and more well kept." "1/27/2010"
"19" "3.0" "This place is more fun then Sea World. The show even starts, while waiting in line. You can see the seals outside.Hands down, the best aquarium I've ever been too! Just go see for yourself. You won't be disappointed. It's been here FOREVER!" "3/21/2008"
"20" "3.0" "Been there 4 or so times, great aquarium, go on Friday nights when its cheaper and there's not a crowd.Would not recommend the extra dollars for the dolphin show, nothing that you haven't seen before if you've seen a dolphin show, actually might be less fun than others.Actually used to be my favorite aquarium until I saw the one in Atlanta." "2/20/2008"
"21" "4.0" "Exhibits are cool and employees knowledgable and friendly. However it gets very crowded, especially with the small areas around the tanks and multiple children mulling around. The number of exhibits although interesting and fun did not seem worth the $25 admission fee. In an effort to control the crowd inside admission is based on timed entry so you may have to wait a few hours to get in or not be able to at all." "2/23/2012"
"22" "3.0" "Really interesting and well put together. I enjoyed the jellyfish exhibit and the 4 D theater was a total hoot! We didn't get to go to the dolphin show bit overall we all really felt it was worth the price." "8/6/2009"
"23" "4.0" "I went to the aquarium as a kid and I went back about 15 years later.  Honestly, the place hasn't changed at all (minus the $30 admissions price).  Everything looks pretty dated- could really use some updating to make it feel more modern.  Feels very 1980.  Still some cool stuff to see, but EXPENSIVE!!!!  The jellyfish exhibit was cool." "5/25/2010"
"24" "5.0" "Best aquarium I have been to (so far).  its going to be super packed on the weekend with soccer moms and children pushing you out of the way to see exhibits.  I was probably one of those children growing up.  If you can go during the weekday you will probably get more out of your visit." "4/9/2009"
"25" "4.0" "This is by far one of my favorite places to visit.  Although I haven't gone in awhile, I'm planning to go again in January and I look forward to seeing the new Australia exhibit.The admission prices are a little steep, but you do get what you pay for.The dolphin show is great and definitely worth checking out, but my favorite has to be the sea turtles and sting rays when you first enter the main floor. . . and the sloths in the Rainforest.The aquarium is very dedicated to conservation and you can even use little parking meter type things to purchase acres in the Amazon to prevent destruction!Allow at least 4 hours for the aquarium, and if you go early enough you still have time to visit the rest of Inner Harbor!" "12/9/2006"
"26" "3.0" "If you are planning to go during any time that might possibly be considered peak - say, a weekend in the summer - then YOU MUST BUY YOUR TICKETS AHEAD OF TIME!  You can do it online, aqua.org/buytickets.html and it's worth the $1.75 service charge.We got there on a Saturday afternoon, and the line was LONG.  It moved quickly, but by the time we got to the front, our \"entrance time\" was TWO hours away!  (When started off in the line, the next available entrance was only half an hour off; the wait was extended that much during our time in line.)  It's a good aquarium once you get inside, but on those busy days it gets crowded and hot.  The kids love it... but I loved the excuse of taking my friend's kid so I could enjoy my own visit too.  I'd try for a weekday or a non-summer day next time." "11/16/2006"
"27" "3.0" "Ok so this one beats the one in DC by far.  Much more to see in a bigger space.  However admission can be quite on the expensive side, and I haven't been since like 1998.  I can't even begin to imagine how much it costs now." "12/6/2010"
"28" "4.0" "Ehhhh.. I've been to much better aquariums. My favorite were the rainforest part (that you can see from the outside at nighttime) and, of course, the sharks. I was extremely disappointed with the dolphin show because of the lack of organization, lack of clarity, and lack of awesome tricks. The people leading it did not seem as into it as the people at other aquariums I've been to. The 4D theatre was AWESOME.The food in the cafe is overpriced and greasy but delicious." "3/17/2009"
"29" "3.0" "Easily the best (only?) aquarium in the region.  A wide variety of exhibits, from local Maryland wildlife to the new Amazon rain forest.The best time to visit is off season, when they have heavily discounted tickets available for Friday evenings. The aquarium also participates in the dollar museum weekend in December -- by far the best deal around." "7/30/2005"
"30" "3.0" "Not too bad, but cannot compare to the Aquarium in Monterey CA. And expensive for what you see." "9/21/2009"
"31" "3.0" "I've been wanting to visit this aquarium since I was 9.  My best friend visited Baltimore while we were in the 4th grade, and when she came back she told me all about the wonders of National Aquarium in Baltimore.I think it's because i finally visited the aquarium as an adult that my experiences there were a little less than wondrous.  Honestly, I expected more out the aquarium.  Maybe some penguins, maybe some seals, maybe some sea lions and manatees.  Maybe interiors and exhibits that don't look as outdated as the Air and Space Museum in DC. The huge tortoises are cool, as are the dolphins and frogs.  Some of the fish are crazy-lookin.   If you go, I recommend purchasing tix for the dolphin show.  They do some lovely tricks.  But the show is a bit short and it's filled with too much  banter and music.  We went early Sunday morning and were the first to enter.  There were many many many children, and the exhibits are, for some reason, located in very small spaces.  In other words, be prepared to have little children all around your feet.  Running into these munchkins, however, should be less of an annoyance than a realization that 'oh yes, this experience is meant for children and not adults.'  Hopefully this will mollify your disappointment.Tickets are expensive.  I got a special deal of $15 per person including the dolphin show through my uni.  Parking in Baltimore can be pretty costly, so you may want to look for street parking several blocks away.  Luckily, we are withiin walking distance.  If I were to do it again, I'd go during the week to avoid crowds.On a side note. we actually rented one of those big, colorful paddle boat dragons in the inner harbor. $10 for 30 minutes.  I think we may have had a better time bicycling our dragon." "12/3/2007"
"32" "5.0" "The National Aquarium is nice. The escalators between the floors is impressive. They do a nice job of showing different habitats and the layout is great at keeping everyone shuffling along the same direction. Everyone always loves seeing the dolphins. I've been to the aquarium twice as a general visitor and once as a guest to an office holiday party that was booked at the aquarium. The reason why I like the Monterey Bay Aquarium a little better is that aquarium focuses completely on their own ecosystem instead of copping out on the ubiquitous tropical critters. I've seen most of the smaller critters, like lion fish, in pet shop aquariums, so it's rather wasted space in a public aquarium. I believe that Monterey Bay was the first public aquarium to exhibit jellyfish. I haven't seen it at Baltimore but it turns out that jellyfish are actually are a very mesmorizing exhibit. If you haven't seen them before in a tank, it's very cool.And the Tampa Aquarium had things I hadn't seen before, like dragon fish. If an aquarium is going to use fish from an outside area, it should use critters that I can't find in the pet store. (Dragon fish are related to sea horses and also are very mesmorizing.)I'd still recommend the aquarium. It's well-designed and it's well-run. The kids have a wonderful time and even the adults get giddy when they see the dolphins." "8/21/2009"
"33" "5.0" "Love this aquarium! The best one I have been to. It can be pricey, however in the off season they run a deal \"5 after 5\" which means its only 5 bucks to get in after 5 o'clock and it's open until 10 pm.Very well run. Good traffic flow. Haven't been since they opened the new Australian branch but I hear good things." "8/9/2006"
"34" "4.0" "The best aquarium I've ever been to. I love the way it's laid out so you don't miss anything. It's almost like the Ikea of aquariums, you go in and then you follow along the hallways and slowly move through each exhibit taking it all in. There aren't a million rooms with different things so you rush around worry you've missed something. The aquarium is huge and takes about five hours to get through. We bought the tickets that included everything including the dolphin show and the 4D special movie they had. I thought it was well worth it since it was only about ten dollars more to get the additional two shows. I also love how the guide gives you the amount of time it will take to get through each one and it was pretty darn accurate! Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Baltimore." "7/19/2009"
"35" "4.0" "I haven't been here since I was a kid, and it made me very happy to return here to still see the large tanks of sting rays and sharks. It is rare that we get to see creatures like these, and the Baltimore Aquarium does an excellent job of keeping up all of the exhibits. There is also a wealth of information to read about the creatures and their habitats. They have even added computer interactive screens to read about each sea animal. The octopus is another excellent exhibit. Really a beautiful creature, but make sure you don't take his picture! Apparently the light bothers them possibly causing them to ink which can be a problem in a small tank. The Jellyfish invasion exhibit is also a great stop. The rainforest is very cool, but it is often difficult to see everything. There are usually colorful birds about. There was a sloth, but he was hiding in a tree. It is still fascinating to be so close to these exotic animals. The dolphin shows are apparently a huge hit here, but if you want to see one, order your tickets ahead of time. They were sold it by the time I arrived today. You can still see the dolphins in their tank even if you don't attend the show. This is a great place to take kids. There is a lot to learn here, but make sure your kids understand how to respect creatures in a tank. Don't tap on the glass! I was a bit irritated by all the poorly behaved children running around, but the ones who were truly fascinated or learning from their parents were endearing enough to take the edge off. If you are headed here on a romantic date, make sure your partner doesn't mind being around kids. There will definitely be a lot of them! Overall, a great experience and enjoy going here. It is expensive, but there is a lot to see." "8/9/2011"
"36" "5.0" "Surprisingly large. Reccomend going earlier in the day to avoid the crowd. Coral reef/pier 4 section was the most extensive and coolest in my opinion. A few large sharks as well, nurse tiger, sand. Didn't see the dolphin show, but did look in the pool, and it seemed cool." "10/5/2009"
"37" "4.0" "I went here a few times a looooooooooooooooong time ago, and I have yet to be to an aquarium that tops the experience I had here when I was younger.  To me, this aquarium beats Monterey Bay hands down.  Hopefully one day I will get a chance to go back to Baltimore, and this will definitely be on my list of places to go again.  After reading all the reviews, I want to visit the Chicago Aquarium next." "8/6/2009"
"38" "5.0" "We took our 15 month old kid, and he loved it! My husband and I purchased a year pass- it was about $100.(It would have cost around $50 for a one time admission for both of us).First, we went to the cool dolphin show, although my son wasn't too interested. The aquarium has a great set-up, they do timed entrances so it was not too crowded. We went on a Sunday, and it was still a little crowded in certain parts.   I think next time we will go during the weekday.  I liked the way it was laid out, there was a little escaltor path to see the different exhibits.  My son was able to enjoy it for 2 hours before getting cranky.  A great place to go on a hot day! I will definitely try to get my money's worth with the year pass..." "7/20/2009"
"39" "5.0" "My first visit to this aquarium came during a trip to see my grandparents in DC when I was 8. After more years between visits than I care to admit, I finally made it back for a winter visit in 2006. It's still my favorite aquarium after all these years.With the big, shiny, Disney-esque Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, it was refreshing to get back to the aquarium in Baltimore for a change of pace. It's nowhere near as large or flashy as Atlanta's, but it certainly feels more intimate and less commercial than what I see with my membership in Georgia. The design and the exhibit layout are more about great views and learning something rather than funneling you toward the gift shop near the exit.Definitely buy tickets in advance during peak hours, and be prepared to be patient with the younger exhibit viewers...they're just excited about what they are seeing and occasionally forget about being polite." "2/12/2007"
"40" NA "I will fully disclose the fact that I am a nature documentary nut, and so any aquarium is right up my alley! I will admit that I was a bit shocked at the price initially, but after experiencing the aquarium, I think that the price can be justified by the amount and quality of the entertainment you experience here. You could easily spend a few hours here, so it's only a little more expensive than seeing a movie. (If you see a movie in a city and get snacks...) I thought the exterior of the building was stunning, and the layout of the aquarium was thoughtful as well. Highlights included getting to see the whale skeleton, and the manta rays from an areal perspective. I have two aquariums at home, and it was super cool to see huge schools of some of my fish in their fake natural habitats. If you find that it is a bit crowded, try going on a weekday during the school year." "7/17/2008"
