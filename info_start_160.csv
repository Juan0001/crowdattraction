"1" "4.0" "I've been to this aquarium several times and have memories of watching the dolphin show as a 7 year-old girl with my family.  I visited this aquarium more recently in mid-January after a birthday lunch with a friend.  My friend and I decided to leave the group to visit this place - we saw some pretty awesome things - we watched the dolphin show (incredible!), visited the multi-layered shark exhibit, saw sea anemones (so cute you just want to poke them!), and of course we saw the jellies!!  There are so many things to do and see at this aquarium.  It's hands down the best aquarium I've ever been to.  I'll continue to visit in the future.Note - it's a little pricey to get in ($25), so make sure to go on a good day when you have plenty of time to make the most of your visit!" "4/3/2013"
"2" "4.0" "Have loved the Aquarium since I was a little kid but I don't think it was 70 dollars for two adults back then! A few things for people to know:1. There is no more dolphin show. I am sure this is great for the dolphins but I did really enjoy that back when. 2. Most exhibits don't open until 10:30 even though the place opens at 9. 3. There is parking validated but make sure you park in the right lot! A bunch of lots nearby have no affiliation!" "4/27/2014"
"3" "5.0" "Ugly a** fishes were the highlight of my aquarium trip! That deep sea ugly you would see on late night Discovery. *Double Take!" "6/20/2013"
"4" "2.0" "I cannot believe it took me so long living in Baltimore before I visited the aquarium! I kept waiting for a good opportunity with an out of town guest but then I finally decided to seize the day and just go! I'm not ashamed to say as a grownup person with no kids in tow that I loved the aquarium. It brought out the eight year old amateur zoologist in me. The highlights were the dolphin show and the shark tank, as well a glimpse of a sloth's butt high, high in the trees in the rainforest exhibit. The building itself is maze-like, but the view of the harbor is unreal, even on a gray rainy day." "1/17/2013"
"5" "3.0" "I absolute love aquatics, and the aquarium is a unique place to go. I've been here a couple of times growing up, and recently I decided to go again just to see the what the aquarium had since I had not been there in a few years. Entering into the aquarium it was just as I remembered it and there weren't that many things to see, mazing through the aquarium. I was hoping to see more fish and other types of sharks and fish or a better scenery. There was not, The aquarium is overall really small and did not have much to see. It took my and my group of friends 20 minutes to walk through the whole place, occasionally stoping to admire the fish for a few minutes or so. There is the new shark place that had different kids of sharks as you walked down the tramps leading down. Fish are beautiful creatures but overall, how the layout of the aquarium is built - it did not create ay fascination of the aquarium. A lot of the audience were little kids/parents who brought their kids and of course the kids were amused with it. I too am usually easily amused, but not in this case. It was overall a disappointment. The prices of the admission are really high as well, I would not pay for the admission price to go here again. The reason I am giving 2 stars for this review is because the fish are beautiful and exotic, I just hope that the National Aquarium is constructed better to build ore of a fascination and structure for the people to enjoy more." "8/19/2014"
"6" "5.0" "I have this 3 instead of 4 stars bc of the price, $35 pp.  nice exhibits, but it doesn't compare to sea world.  Definitely something you may want to do, however there are so many things to do in and around Baltimore, this would not be high on my list." "7/21/2014"
"7" "4.0" "This is such a neat aquarium.  It has a great location over the water and great views from inside.  The inside architecture is neat in that you go up several stories and can see all the way down from each level into a huge pool with rays and sea turtles.  They also have a huge amount of sharks, which is really awesome.  Definitely check this one out if you're in town." "4/27/2014"
"8" "4.0" "I've been here twice and it's great.  The variety of sea life is amazing and dolphin demos are awesome.  One of the things I really like and can be overlooked are the amount of enormous windows for viewing the surrounding harbor.  You can take so many amazing pics without obstructions that you can't get on the floor level.  The world trade center charges to go up to the viewing deck, but I'm sure you get just as good a view while taking a break from the sea life.The items in the main gift shop are all so unique.  The gift shops around the location are okay, but not as vast.I really wish the aquarium would list exhibits that are closed on their website.  I checked to see if such a thing was going on and didn't see anything.  When we go there the entire stingray exhibit was closed.  That's one of the biggest attractions there and the only way you find out its closed is when you're greeted by a huge black curtain blocking the exhibit entrances and signs stating \"construction.\"" "6/23/2013"
"9" "3.0" "This review is for the Shark Sleepover, which turned out to be pretty amazing. This Immersion Tour (they also have a Dolphin Sleepover) offers a way to get check out the entire aquarium with just a small group, rather than having to fight the crowds to see the animals/take photos during normal business hours.It's a little pricey ($115 per person for kids and adults), but includes a guided tour by a staff scientist through the entire aquarium to include some behind the scenes areas, dinner that night in the cafe, breakfast the following morning, a 4D movie, and a fun night of camping out on the floor by the shark tanks for the kiddos. Sleeping accommodations are definitely no-frills, and I was kinda sad they turned the tank lights out at night, but it was definitely a really memorable experience. Re-entry the following day is included as well if the family wants to have time to peruse at their leisure a second time around. We hung out til about 11am and then migrated out in order to use the reduced parking coupon ($8 if you're out of the garage by noon). Definitely recommend!" "4/13/2014"
"10" "2.0" "We enjoy going but it's ALWAYS too busy.  But if you go early you can beat some of the crowds and actually get to see the animals.  The kids are a bit short still (3 and 1 year olds), so that makes it tough. No strollers allowed inside but they do have a check in room for them.  It's pricy.  And I recommend leaving for meals as the lunch room is over priced and loud.  You can actually get out and come back in from the lunch room area to avoid spending money here - NOT WORTH IT.  But we loved the animals, the jellys were awesome to watch.  And the dolphin show was pretty neat.  They were cleaning the tank for the rays last time I was there so they were not in the really neat tank in the entrance.  The stores have lots of fun things to buy too." "6/10/2013"
"11" "4.0" "Way overpriced. Confusing layout. Not a lot to see and very overcrowded. There was supposed to be a talk about the \"Blue Wonders\" at 2:30, which never happened. The dolphin \"show\" was at 3:00 when it was listed to start at 3:15. It only last 10 minutes. Most of the \"shows\" here are just feedings where you watch the animals get fed. The rainforest was a bust, didn't see anything. Don't waste the money and go see some free museums in DC." "3/29/2015"
"12" "2.0" "I have visited this aquarium more than a few times since moving to Baltimore.  Highly enjoy it each & every time we visit.If at all possible, avoid visiting on a weekend.  Way too crowded (seriously, waaaaaaaaay too crowded).  The dolphin show used to be an extra cost but it is now free with your admission (though the admission is now set at a slightly higher price, I'm assuming, to accommodate the show).  The show is a great one, though.  And a nice break if you're visiting with kids.  Our absolute favorite exhibit has to be the Australian exhibit.  Make sure to take a moment & chat with the aquarium staff strategically placed throughout the exhibits.  They are highly informative & will point out creatures you most likely have missed... like the huge (HUUUUGE) bats hanging upside down freely inside the Australian exhibit ;)NO STROLLERS allowed.  You can bring one in but you will have to park it.  I believe they offer a backpack-like carrier for your baby if you want one.  We just bring our hiking backpack for our baby & it works out perfectly.  Again, if you want to enjoy the aquarium to it's full potential, try to visit it during the week.The parking near by is pricey, too ($20).  So, plan ahead since this visit will probably run you a small fortune." "2/27/2013"
"13" "4.0" "I have had better experiences here but this time was just way too crowded. We arrived around 1 and was told the tickets we are buying wont allow us in until 215 so we had to wait outside in the heat with two 1 year olds. Once we got in we had to check our stollers in as you can not go through the aquarium with one and they did not have any backpacks for the children left so i had to carry my child the entire time. The temperature was like 100 degrees and i poured sweat the entire time. Im not skinny to say the least but i was soaked when we left. People would not move from exhibit to exhibit and would just stand taking 100 pics of the same fish. I would finally make it up to the glass with my daughter only to have a family somehow squeeze inbetween me and the exhibit without saying excuse me or im sorry. I became very upset and might have accidently let some obscenities out. I missed exhibits only because there was no way i was going to fight the crowd. The cafeteria was not good and they forgot my order. I had to ask for my food 20 mins later after realizing everyone after me was receiving theirs. The only exhibit i really enjoyed was the underwater view of the main exhibit with the huge turtle. I will return only because i enjoy aquariums a lot and i want my daughter to experience aquarium when she is older. Hopefully we will enjoy it next time." "9/16/2014"
"14" "2.0" "WOW, this aquarium has a DOLPHIN show upstairs!The layout is great. You flow through each exhibit so that you don't miss anything. You can walkthrough the whole thing in an 1 hour or spend the whole day there. It just depends on what interests your group.Do NOT miss the Dolphin show!Also, bring snacks or eat before you come. The food is So-So but very $$$.On crowded days (like weekends or holidays) NO STROLLERS." "4/23/2013"
"15" "5.0" "Definitely thought this would be better by the reviews, but there are more gift shops and food court areas than exhibits.  Besides the not very friendly employees and the high price, this aquarium is sub-par than the many I have visited around the country.  There are some positives and that would include the large fish tank, but that is about it.  The dolphin exhibit, which does not have \"shows\", has several \"training events\" throughout the day.  There are only a couple of exhibits besides the Dolphin area... the jelly fish, large central fish tank, Rain Forest, and the Australian exhibit." "11/30/2013"
"16" "4.0" "Food: 1/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 5/5Decor & Style: 5/5Yes this is one of the bests i've seen in the US. But  I still rank it as my 3rd favorite one. However, the dolphin show here was better than Sea World Orlando! The dolphins mimicking the trainers was hilarious. Something I did not see in Orlando.1. Monterey Bay2. Dallas3. B-MoreOh and don't eat the pizza here." "11/22/2011"
"17" "4.0" "Went with husband and 2 children. It was about $100 for all of us. We spent about 4 hours there so it was worth the price. Lots of neat exhibits and helpful staff. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the food at the restaurant sucked and was over priced. Eat before you come! Also you have to check your stroller so if you have small children, bring a leash or backpack." "2/19/2014"
"18" "5.0" "I haven't been to the National Aquarium since elementary school field trips. Spending the day at Baltimore's Inner  Harbor, I decided to be a true tourist and check out the aquarium. The aquarium changed a lot over the years. The ticket line was very long but moved fast (Saturday evening).It's probably best to purchase your tickets in advance to avoid standing in long lines (AAA members get a discount). It's no fun standing in a long line on a hot & humid day in Baltimore. The architect design of the building is amazing because it keeps the traffic flowing throughout the aquarium. The National Aquarium has some cool animals, amphibian, and birds. My favorite part of the aquarium was seeing sharks up close, dolphins, and the different jelly fish. There's a dolphin show for customers at selected times. Although traffic moved steady, the aquarium was very busy at the dolphin and jelly fish exhibition. You're allowed to take pictures at most of the exhibitions. Staff takes your picture with cool backgrounds which you can purchase before you exit the aquarium. The parking is a hassle. Customers get $5 off parking if you validate your parking ticket at certain decks near the harbor (validate your ticket inside the aquarium at the information desk). The National Aquarium is family friendly. If you never been to the National Aquarium, its a cool experience. Note:The National Aquarium should consider offering student discounts in my opinion because the admission is a bit pricey." "9/19/2013"
"19" "4.0" "I haven't been in years. So this excursion was extra special. They have a new (to me) Australia exhibit. The jelly fish room was creepy and beautiful and spectacular. And as it always was, the 360 shark tank is incredible. What was extra special was one of the scuba men was dressed as Santa. All the kids were having a blast. And I totally hammed it up for a picture with Santa." "1/12/2014"
"20" "4.0" "I just got home my trip to the aquarium!  There are a lot of pros, and it was worth the 4 hour drive to get here.  The animals are great and ambiance makes it fascinating.  Here's what to expect:  1.  Parking in the garage will cost you $24.  It's not affiliated with the aquarium.  You can take your ticket to an information desk in the aquarium to get $5 off making the parking ticket $19.  2. $35 per person.  It's expensive and I might feel that it was too expensive.  But, the aquarium is non profit and the the water filtration system must be worth millions.  Also, there is probably a veterinary staff employed there.  It takes a lot of money to run this place!3.  Kids. Kids. Kids.  Take this comment for what it is.  The higher price of the aquarium seems to attract parents that raise their kids well and correct bad behavior in an instant.  When the little kids started to scream or get out of hand, the parents seemed to handle it on the spot.  I think if the admission was $5 per person, you'd see a lot of temper tantrums and kids running around largely unsupervised.  4. We got to the aquarium around 10:45 on a Saturday morning.  The line to get a ticket was about 20 minutes.  Our ticket was stamped for 11:45 admission so we walked around the pier before getting in line to go in.  I think they let too many in at once because there were almost too many people in there. A lot of the exhibits were difficult to see.  If you want a head start, order tickets online and go to will call.  5.  People go crazy with their iPhones and other devices.  They will take 10 pictures of each of fish..not really but it gets annoying.6.  The tour is pretty well laid out.  You will go through a series of escalators and moving sidewalks.  You go at your own pace.  7.  The rain forest is hot an humid but very cool!8.  The cafe has a good selection of pizza, nachos, etc.  9. Expect to spend about 3 hours here.  We walked around at a pretty slow pace and watched s dolphin show (which was fantastic).  We didn't eat, but we did take a 10 minute stroll through the large souvenir shop.  I think my favorite part was the rain forest.  The turtles were cool and they had an Amazon parrot.  Oh, and some cool monkeys overhead!" "8/23/2014"
"21" "5.0" "This place is better than SF Aquarium and Monterey Bay Aquarium, HANDS DOWN. This place is humongous and we spent a good 5 hours here to see everything. The pier at Baltimore is also much better than the SF Pier." "6/8/2014"
"22" "4.0" "So beautiful. A must see. One of the most amazing things is the structure. You see everything and it's very interactive. Loved the amount of displays. A must see of Baltimore." "5/28/2014"
"23" "5.0" "I'm a sucker for anything relating to animals and wildlife, so for me it was without hesitation to visit the national aquarium when I was in the inner harbor area (central) of Baltimore, Maryland...adult admission was about $35 but worth the price when compared to the one located in Washington, DC (surprisingly that was a major disappointment; super small, dingy, tanks with no fishes having me cry where is nemo? and  underground of a building)...this place was expansive with lots of different exhibits of fishes, sharks and other marine animals...what I love was their short videos and their educational displays...as you walk along the path you find yourself going up escalators to several floors of huge tanks with sharks until you reach the top of the building which includes a forest and sort of an arboretum type of thing to include monkeys and other animals..this is not your average aquarium and I thought this was very impressive and the facility was kept well..." "2/8/2015"
"24" "4.0" "Greatest aquarium I've been to. Though the dolphin show has been removed, the thousands of other exhibits provide all demographics with sights to see: stingrays, sea turtles, sharks, seahorses. The layout allows easy and organized access to the whole aquarium while providing chances to slip away from the crowd and skip around." "8/5/2014"
"25" "4.0" "ot just for the kidsMan can intrigue his date hereMind will be at ease...yes that was a haiku review (not a good one but a haiku none the less)The aquarium has some really nice exhibits. I especially like the jellyfish. You will find everything from dolphins to frogs and even a sloth here. My only complaint is that I feel a little sad about the dolphins having to spend their life in an indoor pool (see documentary Blackfish). Having said that, we enjoyed our visit. Check out the Friday evening discounts, it's much cheaper." "12/31/2013"
"26" "4.0" "If you enjoy science and have a particular curiosity about the ocean, the National Aquarium is a must see when in Baltimore.  Among the many impressive features include a well stocked shark tank, a dolphin show and an eerily hypnotic jellyfish room.  There's also a full area dedicated to bright and deadly poison dart frogs, a rainforest area with lots of birds and a few piranhas and tank after tank of exotic fishes, turtles and reptiles.PARTING THOUGHT: I think the jellyfish room would be enormously popular if they recreated it in Amsterdam..." "11/2/2012"
"27" "3.0" "Visiting Baltimore periodically, the National Aquarium is always worth a spot on my itinerary!  Between the varied exhibits, clean and modern facilities, and great staff, I'd highly recommend this aquarium to others!On our most recent visit, their special rotating exhibit was the \"Jellyfish Invasion\" and was located near the Dolphin Discovery area inside the Pier 4 Pavilion.  The jellies were awesome and majestic to look at, and the lighting in this area really enhanced the creepiness of the fish!  (pic 1: yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…  pic 2: yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…)The Dolphin Discovery area is enclosed mostly by glass, drenching the 1.5 million dolphin tank in natural light while also providing a nice view of the surrounding harbor area.  Shows run throughout the day and are typically 15-20 minutes in length.  We attended two different shows on the same day and found there to be a bit too much \"introductory talking,\" like about what it takes to be a dolphin trainer and other aspects of the job (cleaning the tank, buying fish, etc.)  While I respect their work and efforts, I think a lot of this dialog could have been summed up on a plaque or sign as you were entering the stadium-seating area.  Honestly, we were all there to see the dolphins do flips, throw balls, and splash people in the front rows anyway!  The second show definitely featured more of these \"tricks,\" but again, was a bit heavy on the talk...It's definitely still worth visiting though, especially since this live show is free with the admission.Aside from that, there's the massive Pier 3 Pavilion, where visitors slowly ascend up through three stories of well-described tanks and exhibits, cross through a rainforest, and descend through coral reefs, stingrays, and shark tanks.  The Pier 3 Pavilion is very well laid out, allowing more detail-oriented patrons to navigate through every crevasse, while also providing plenty of ways to \"skip\" certain areas.If you're wiling to shell out $30 for a visit here, it's definitely a fun and educational experience, and a great addition to a day of sightseeing around Baltimore's Inner Harbor!" "10/11/2012"
"28" "3.0" "I was in Baltimore on a Friday and had two hours to kill before catching a train at 3, so I thought I'd go check out the National Aquarium. I'm from Atlanta and we have a pretty spectacular aquarium down there, so I thought the \"National\" aquarium could only be better. LOL.You know that part in Gulliver's Travels where the dude wakes up on an island to find he's being surrounded by a bunch of tiny little people? This is what the National Aquarium felt like. There were about a million little kids who were like 5 inches tall just running around your ankles, trying to escape from their harassed-looking parents who had like another 3 screaming kids in their arms. It was hard to get a close look at most of the exhibits because people were plastered to the glass like octopi. The only place that wasn't insanely overcrowded was the Australian exhibit, which was actually kind of nice and had a cool rainforest-y feel.In conclusion: avoid. You're an hour from DC, just go to the National Zoo instead. IT'S FREE AND IT HAS PANDAS." "10/22/2013"
"29" "4.0" "We couldn't even see the rays or sea turtle on this last visit :(  they are moving everything around due to construction the tank at the bottom of the exhibit is empty and a mess. We paid an extra 5 bucks for a 4-D Salmon film experience which happened to be scheduled at the same time as the last dolphin show of the evening which we had to leave shortly after it finally started to catch the film. Poor planning Aquarium.Excited about our new black tip reef shark exhibit being constructed. But bring back the rays and sea turtles ASAP!" "4/7/2013"
"30" "4.0" "I LOVE fish and love coming this aquarium. The price can be a little bit much which is why I decided to just donate money to the ocean and got a membership. I can go anytime I want without a wait and get to go to free member events which are pretty cool after hours. I have gone to the aquarium 10 times this year for the price of only 2 tickets. The staff is not always the nicest but the people who are working behind the scenes and working with the animals are amazing. My favorite animal has to be Calypso, the 3 finned sea turtle. The new blacktip reef exhibit is really cool especially when you are in the underwater viewing area. I highly recommend dishing out the cash to get a membership. You get a discount on everything including parking, food, and gifts." "7/10/2014"
"31" "4.0" "I remember seeing the sign and doing a double take when I found out that the adult ticket price was $35.  Of course the first thing I did was to see if there was some sort of Yelp check-in offer.  Then I frantically checked to see if there was a Groupon or a Living Social.  Thoroughly defeated, I forked over the money and was prepared to feel ripped off.But no...I left this place wondering how they could afford to run the place on just the visitor fees alone.  Thankfully there were plaques everywhere with the names of the 1%-ers commemorating their support for the aquarium (thank you rich guys!).This is not your typical aquarium where you shuttle from tank to tank in a sprawling open air facility.  Everything is housed inside a glass and steel high rise.  It's sort of laid out like the Guggenheim where a roughly spiral walkway beckons you to go higher to see the next set of displays.  There is an incredibly large saltwater shark tank in the center where you can peek out and see the myriad of sharks from up top or admire them from the ground level.  It's so large and deep that you kind of have to fight the urge to jump into it, which is why perhaps there are sharks in the water but no need for railings on the walkway.There were lots of different marine species but to give the visitor even more value there was a rain forest exhibit that had lots of species of birds in attendance.  There was also some golden tamarinds and bats that seemed out of place here.  The stars of the show here are the bottle nose dolphins.  Thankfully the show was free and happened frequently, so there was plenty of good seating.Like I said, I was really impressed with how well thought out and maintained this aquarium was.  From someone who is used to seeing the now woefully outdated New York Aquarium, the National Aquarium was definitely an above the board experience." "10/21/2013"
"32" "5.0" "I really enjoyed the National Aquarium during my stay in Maryland in 2010! I did attend the Dolphin show while there, which is something that I would no longer participate in due to forcing animals to perform in captivity, but it seems to have had updates since, so I am unsure as to what the dolphin experience is like now. Extracting myself from my biases, the show really wasn't worth the money. The animals were hard to see except for when they jumped out of the water and the show wasn't too entertaining with the trainers barking commands most of the time. As for the rest of the exhibits, the thing that impressed me the most was the open aquarium! You could look right down and see the sea life swimming in front of your eyes, with no glass barrier! Don't miss the giant turtle when you go! Wow was that a great thing to experience- unique too! The wildlife that this aquarium has is really exotic and fun to learn about! I would  not go to this aquarium all of the time, due to the price and the support of animals in the entertainment industry via the dolphin show, but I did enjoy my visit years ago and would consider going back." "9/29/2014"
"33" "4.0" "Back to normal!  Presentation interspersed with quiet times to just watch these wonderful creatures!!!" "7/24/2014"
"34" "4.0" "Not only am I fan of this place but I'm also a member!Seriously, though, I hadn't visited this place in 15 years yet it felt like coming home when I finally went back. My old favorite exhibits were still there and they have some interesting new ones. On top of that, the new layout for entrance and exit is quite nice, especially combined with the timed entry during busy times (to prevent too many people from going in).Some notes for visitors...Your best bet for parking is the Lockwood Place Garage between Gay and Market (across Pratt from the Aquarium and Power Plant). Parking is $20.00/3 hours, but you'll receive a discount if your ticket is validated at the Aquarium.Come early! I cannot emphasize this enough at any tourist attraction, especially on weekends. The earlier you are the less people you will have to deal with. Although they do begin timed entry for later in the afternoon (to limit the flow of visitors), you will still have to contend with many people trying to look through glass windows at the same time.Eat before or after, but not at the aquarium. The food isn't bad but it is worse than sports stadium prices. There are plenty of eateries throughout the Inner Harbor that you can find better selections for good cost.People with babies and toddlers, they do not allow strollers in the aquarium. There is an area inside where you can store your stroller and they will give you a chest carrier (baby bjorn) to use throughout the day. If you cannot handle a child strapped to your chest, weight pulling on your shoulders and back... don't bring your kid here!If you take all of this into account, you can expect a wonderful visit. The aquarium will definitely fill up a few hours (depending on your speed) and is a great compliment to any day spent in the Inner Harbor." "7/31/2012"
"35" "5.0" "This aquarium made me want to become a Marine Biologist. My dad and I started visiting this spot ever since I was a little girl. We would make the drive from PA, super easy shot on 95 and spend time in Inner Harbor. It's set right on the harbor and is a gorgeous building. I can't speak to the pricing as when I was younger, no clue and as I am older, my father and his wife are members so I was in as their guest. When you enter the first things you really spend time at is the sting ray area and it's so awesome just to look down on their habitat and check out all the different turtles and fish as the stingrays glide by. It's very cool when they have a diver in there and they walk you through the history etc. Any diver added in the tanks really puts into perspective that we are invading their world and not them, ours. The layout is pretty flow friendly as it takes you up the aquarium in one path and allows you to pass everything so you don't miss some exhibits. I do think it appeared much larger when I was a child as when I returned this summer as an adult, I felt like we got through everything within an hour, it also could have been because I have been there so many times. The shark tank on the way down is really cool. It's dark and you can see the shark and fish up close in the 3 story tank. My favorite part will always be the Dolphin show but I have to say, I am extremely disappointed that times have changed so much in the Marine Biology world that we can't see the trainers swim with their dolphins. I completely understand the risk and sad happenings that other locations have lived through but this was a huge highlight for me when I was younger. Learning about the relationship of trainer and dolphin, the Bo and Taz show, learning about the baby dolphins born in captivity... really pulled on my heart strings. Now the show consists of some tricks but no trainers in the water. Just the dolphins, facts and learnings and some video. Still a great show but just so different from what I was used to.Overall this is a great day trip or must see stop when you are in Baltimore." "10/18/2012"
"36" "4.0" "Great! Had a lot of fun. I think $20-25 would be a more fitting price here (it's $35)." "8/5/2014"
"37" "5.0" "I really enjoyed my trip to see this aquarium! One of the men working there was a little awkward. I went in one of the exhibits and it was open and other people were there. He kept saying \"You have to view this exhibit out there, or you miss the second floor. They aren't connected.\" But where he was referring to was chaos, so I wanted to stay away from the crowds. And every time I explained that he said \"No, you need to view the exhibit that way or you miss part of it.\" Finally he seemed annoyed and said \"Fine, you can see that after.\" I felt really uncomfortable though. The section I was in was open, it just wasn't swarmed with little kids. Other than that, everything was really good. I loved the jellyfish exhibit! The parking was ridiculously expensive though, even after the ticket was validated. It was deceiving on the website." "1/3/2014"
"38" "4.0" "Like all places like this it cost a lot for food and gifts. We got here at open saw the staff feed the animals, no waits and spent time watching the dolphins.

"39" "4.0" "I love this place.  I've been many times since I was a kid and now I take my kids.  The only downside is the price.  If you don't have a membership you will also wait awhile.  Last year I bought a family membership and really enjoyed it.  If they could make their prices more affordable for larger parties that would be awesome.  A lot of people don't have just one child and when you have a larger family, fun outings like this aren't always affordable."

We got there and the line was wrapped around the building. I was shocked when the line moved within the hour we were in! They were VERY organized and efficient. Again, expecting to get inside and it be crowded with a ton of people but once again pleasantly surprised! They had a system in place to get folks inside in intervals which didn't compromise the experience. The exhibits were good and presenters were great. I really enjoy aquariums and have been to a number of them and this was a good experience. I would go again." "1/24/2015"
