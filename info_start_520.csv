"3.0" "You know I was extremely excited to go to Baltimore to see this place.. Let me tell you about the crap-tacular time I had at this place. I walked around for about an hour to see not so stunning exhibits on animals that didn't seem all to lively. I paid 22 for parking at a lot close to that water front.. The rain forest was cool for about 5 minute then it gets to hot. An the mist that they spay on you every 10 seconds makes you think you are getting pooped on by the birds that are floating around making noises.. Yet you can hardly see them.. I smell special effects..  The Dolphins were unimpressive. The Shark sections left me feeling like I walked into a giant downward spiral.. OH WAIT.. IT IS. Did i mention that you walk all the way to the top of the place to see tiny exhibits of animals you can't take a picture of.. Where was the interactive fun for the children. Screw that where was the interactive fun for the person who drove 3 1/2 hours for this crap. I don't recommend this to anyone.." "9/16/2010"
"3.0" "Ok. Expected better service from cafe workers. Eat before you come everything is expensive. Nice attractions different types of fish sharks etc." "5/22/2009"
"5.0" "I went to the aquarium last year so I hope my memory is good enough to describe what I saw. The surrounding area was pretty nice. Of course they have different varieties of sea animals, fish,etc. While you 're going up, there's a huge skeleton of a whale hanging by the circular escalator going up to the 2nd and 3rd floor. The dolphin show which you have to pay extra was very nice. Sorry couldn't remember more." "5/12/2011"
"4.0" "At least tied with the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California for best aquarium that I've visted.  I go every time I'm in back in town.  I love B'more and this is another reason why.I love the displays and it's a fun outing with my nephew.  There are also nearby things to keep kids busy, too." "12/17/2006"
"4.0" "There's a special place in my heart for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I love how they integrate the views and the bay and all the cute animals and exhibits, from the sea otters to the stingray and starfish petting zoo. But I was really blown away by Balto's aquarium. I found the admission price pretty steep ($23) but I really see why. (Tip: buy your tickets in advance--you can even do it online!) It's a thoughtfully planned out venue where the flow is in an upward spiral, so you get to see everything. And the sharks! I've never seen so many varieties of shark contained in one space. Both frightening and absolutely wonderful. I loved their Amazon jungle recreation, and all the rainforest frogs and animals, especially the giant sea turtle and even the crocodiles. If you're a regular kid or kid at heart who loves the deep sea, put this on your must-see list." "12/1/2006"
"2.0" "I love this aquarium, great date place, but not that i would know (been married for 5 years) but i have been told.Kids dig it, chicks dig it, and it is really coolIt is a little pricey, i think they are up to like $24/person.  Kind of ridiculous but if you look at everything they have to pay for.  That place can't be cheep to run.If you are traveling to B-More, you have to go to the aquarium, hon."

"5.0" "Keeping in mind that I went on a Saturday afternoon and if I'd consulted yelp I may have slightly different view concerning the crowds I still  feel the following thoughts are consistently appropriate regardless.  I was expecting the aquarium to be some kind of marvel like.... walking through the ocean or something since the vast majority of my friends acted like it was the best place they'd ever been. When i got there I was excited  to see a timed entrance and even though I new I'd have to wait I took solace in the impending organization as well as the crowd control...Um crowd control pipe dreams aside when I walked in the doors the building was hot and smelly. Okay okay, okay I'm at an aquarium , I'm quite aware there are certain smells that accompany being there but I think this place smelled unkempt.  (The smell may have been exacerbated by the hot environment)  There was trash on the floor, it was crowded and poorly mapped, the escalators bottle necked, I wish you'd had the option of stair use This place seemed like a fire trap, It was impossible to see anything, I enjoyed the 4d show but calling it a movie is laughable since it felt like I'd just set down when I got up.  The  variety of available fish was disappointing the dolphin show was basically a really difficult to hear infomercial for \"being green\" with a few and I mean very few tricks performed.  The staff was not knowledgeable about the exhibits I felt ripped off when I left what an embarrassing national aquarium. I concede  I may have had a different experience if there wasn't a crowd but I've been to LOTS of crowded places that where cheaper, cleaner brighter better stocked, with a better informed staff. I really wish I liked the aquarium but I have got to disagree with most of the other yelpers its a two star at best at this point in time maybe with a renovation, and better crowd control, staff trainings, air conditioning and a few structural modifications it could be four or five stars but right now two is generous." "5/16/2010"
"5.0" "The National Aquarium was fantastic.  We sat for the dolphin show and were blown away when 5 adults all became misty-eyed at the sight of a dolphin swimming across a pool.  That and remembering what it was like to be a kid while watching all the kids run up to the edge of the pool to get splashed on a cold, rainy winter day.After the dolphin show, we walked through the entire aquarium.  I really enjoyed their exhibits.  Well arraigned with helpful volunteers who would point out otherwise hidden animals.  The only issue we came across was being shoved out of the way by large groups of kids when we were trying to look at exhibits.  My one suggestion is figure out how frequently the waves of kids come through and plan accordingly." "12/23/2008"
"3.0" "The best aquarium hands down on the east coast.     I am used to the dirty and small Brooklyn Aquarium, so when my wife and I visited Baltimore last summer we were stunned by this behemoth on the Inner Harbor. We waited on a very long line on this 4th of July weekend so everyone was out and about on this warm summer day. Out of no where some guy approaches us with 2 tickets and says \"I was just called into work and my company gave me some comp tickets, you want them?\" As a typical New Yorker I am hesitant thinking \"whats the catch?\". He said no catch and does not want money since they were free. He gave them to us, we get off that dreaded line and like aquarium vips we walk into this amazing place.     They have pretty much every kind of creature you would think of at this location. It is right by all the action of the Inner Harbor with a giant Barnes and Noble mega store next door and Cheesecake Factory, Phillips Seafood and Hard Rock in the distance. Hotels also close by and a shopping mall too. Definitely make it part of your next Baltimore trip." "6/15/2008"
"3.0" "Ok...If you need a reminder as to why you don't want to have children, this is a great place to go in the summer. This place is like the birth-control poster child breeding ground during those three months. If you have children, and you want them to be happy and learn about sea life, avoid the aquarium during the summer. Your children will cry because it is dark, because they can't see you, and because they can't see the exhibits; it's not going to be fun for you or them. I don't know who designed this place, but apparently they were hitting the crack pretty hard. Actually, that's not fair; it was designed according to the brilliant standards of the 1970s, which means a whole lot of blank concrete and not enough exhibit space....as we all know, buildings that date to this time period have aged so well. The exhibition spaces are tiny, and kind of revolve around the diorama set-up. This means that 30+ people and children are crammed together at any given time to view an exhibit that is presented through a 12'x6' window. Be prepared: kids will ram into your legs and try to physically push you out of the way so that they can see the action...and their parents probably won't do anything about it. Basically the entire aquarium is set up this way, with the exceptions being the giant sting ray atrium, the three story spiraling exhibit, and the Australian exhibit. Unfortunately, the majority of your time is spent in the cramped areas, so by the time you get to the better areas you're pretty much done with being in the building. You definitely will start to feel a little bitter about the $20+ you spent to visit this poorly aging marvel. The Atlanta Aquarium this is not. Actually this is probably one of the worst aquariums I have ever visited, and I've been to a few. The stingray atrium is the only reason this place is getting three stars.Should you decide that you absolutely must visit the aquarium, buy your tickets in advance. I did not attend the dolphin show; however, I did visit the dolphin area, and it's a great place to show your kids what happens when marine mammals are confined with minimal stimulation. Hey Billy! She those repetitive behaviors! Go early in the day so that you can find parking, and be prepared to shell out for that as well. Or, just go to the National Zoo instead." "9/19/2007"
"3.0" "It's definitely nowhere near the Monterey Bay aquarium but if you're in Baltimore and wanted to see some fish its not bad. I just wouldn't pay $20 - $25 because you can go through it all in an hour and a half and a few of the areas are kinda lame." "1/13/2008"
"4.0" "This was the first time I have ever been to the National Aquarium in Baltimore.  I have to say that I was not impressed.  The lighting in the place is horrible.  I expected to see more varieties of cooler fish.  They had some sharks and a couple of other nice marine animals.  The admission price is pretty high and parking is ridiculously expensive.  The 4D Planet Earth show was decent. The dolphin show was nothing special.  If you never been there before I would recommend going just to say you have been there but nothing to write home about." "9/19/2010"
"2.0" "I took my daughter and a friend today. I have to say I was very impressed with the aquarium but not as impressed with the shows they had. Not that they weren't good entertainment they were just too short. I dont know how much extra we paid for a 4D movie that lasted 10 minutes maximum but I hope it wasnt alot. The movie was cool and so were the effects but it was so short it almost seemed choppy. The Dolphin show was really fun and educational but also a bit short for me." "4/24/2010"
"5.0" "The admission price is wicked steep.No penguins, no seals, no sea lions.The highlight is definitely the sloths in the rainforest. But WTF, go to the national zoo if you want to see sloths. Next best was the frogs but I dunno if that is a permanent exhibit.Been to better, for cheaper." "5/23/2007"
"4.0" "I love this aquarium!  My dad used to take me whenever I would visit him when I was a kid.  My favorite thing is the seals out front!  SO COOL!  I could stare at them for hours.  I now live in the same city as the world's largest aquarium, Georgia Aquarium, but I just love Baltimore's so much more." "9/19/2007"
"4.0" "Decided to cross the Baltimore Aquarium off my list today as places I wanted to visit.  I read some reviews on yelp before I left today and got a little nervous.  However, I ended up having a great time!  I can't comment on the dolphin and 4d show as I didn't have time to attend either show today, but I thought the aquarium itself was good.  Is it the best aquarium I've ever been to in my life?  No, but it is definitely worth the 3 hours I've been there.  Things I would point out are: Yes, if you can figure out what time you're going to be at the aquarium buy your tickets online.  When I got there at 3 pm today to buy tickets in person the check in time was 4:30pm.  Next, don't worry about what exhibits you want to see, there's really only one route to go through.  What I remember most are the puffkins and the clownfish.  All in all a great time!" "7/5/2010"
"5.0" "This is such a great aquarium, located right on the scenic Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland. They have a great collection of sea creatures, and it's all very well set up. The eatery has good food. The exhibits are constantly changing, which I really respect. Some places stay the same forever! I love how they use different lighting to cast cool effects in certain areas of the aquarium. The only thing I don't like about it is the admission. It's way too high! But I'd say it's worth it - and repeat visits are highly recommended!" "9/23/2007"
"4.0" "I grew up going here for field trips.  When I got older, I went on dates here.  Fridays after five, prices take a dive.  I haven't been in years, but when I've been to several other aquariums and this one is still the best." "6/27/2007"
"4.0" "Went there on a school trip a few years back and I have to say it's actually a really cool aquarium to go to. I never really thought much of aquariums before this always just saw them as big fish tanks with really expensive fish, but this place really reintroduced me to the aquarium experience. They are very informative, very fun, and the best part is it dusty have that really musty, wet smell that most aquariums tend to have. It is actually perfect for a one-day trip, a few times I even found myself just staring at a certain fish for ten minutes at a time even forgetting to blink at some points. Their dolphin show is also really cool to watch, if you've seen a dolphin show before there's nothing really different. But it's always cool watching dolphins do what they do. If your ever looking for something to do for the day but can't think of what the National Aquarium is definitely the place to visit." "3/22/2009"
"3.0" "lovely aquarium (shark exhibit was the best!), though i think it would've been nice to add some more local flavor to the area, as i ended up eating at the hard rock cafe!" "6/11/2008"
"3.0" "The reviews are all over the place on the Baltimore Aquarium.  I guess I would reiterate a lot of what's been said; both good and bad.  Needs some renovation, it was very crowded and difficult to see the exhibits, it's expensive (+$20 for parking) and the dolphin show is just so-so.  But there's not much else like it around the Bal-Wash metro area and there's lots to see and learn here.  My guess is that a fall/winter visit would be a much better idea.  And the Australia exhibit is pretty cool." "8/26/2007"
"4.0" "pretty cool aquarium. the shark tank is nice. the dolphins show is ok. might be worth it for the kids. I didn't find it that entertaining. they also have a very nice rain forest inside. it will be a very enjoyable visit" "7/16/2009"
"5.0" "very impressive, i easily spent a few hours here. the 4D immersion movie was a hit! definitely see that. the dolphin show was ok, sit in the front and you will get splashed! it's a little short show though. the aquarium itself was very well constructed. it's a walking tour per se. the main tanks are vertical and the aquarium is like a parking garage, you go from level to level seeing all the displays. there's also a lobby air condition sitting area that overlooks the bay. I think it was close to $30. if you're military buy them before you arrive, they won't give the military discount at the window." "8/19/2009"
"5.0" "One of the better aquariums that I have visited and i dont' mind the admission fee because you get a lot for what you pay for plus you're  probably doing a good thing.  C'mon the money goes towards helping the ami-nals! (yes i know i spelled that wrong).Large sting ray tank w/ cute chubby turtle that was missing a front flipper due to hypothermia inflicted amputation.  Tons of frogsto look at too - in an effort to save them from the plague that is killing of many frogs :( :(  Like how they divided up the fishy tanks by region - although I wish the murky fish (super deep dwelling fish) would have showed some more light! It was so hard to see!!The dolphin show is cute - not quite the same as Seaworld, but its not bad for only being like $3-4 more on top of admission prices.  Splash zone is a joke.  I made my whole family sit w/ me in front and center cuz i wanted to see them get soaked - and only got slightly sprinkled on." "9/12/2006"
"5.0" "If you are coming to Baltimore make sure to plan a stop here.  The information they provide with every exhibit is very informative and interesting.  Great for kids of all ages 0-199!!!!  Plus the Dolphin show is cool!" "7/6/2007"
"4.0" "Best Aquarium Ever." "4/9/2007"
"3.0" "This place is cool and definitely kids would enjoy it. I was driving to Philly and on the way stopped in Baltimore to eat. Heard form locals that this place is nice and so went to check out and found it really nice. Located next to USS Constellation. Both these place are worth the money and time." "3/6/2009"
"4.0" "The jelly fish invasion was the best part of this aquarium since they had more jelly fish displays than in any other aquarium I have been to. The shark display as well as the one with the octopus were great too especially since most  aquariums don't have that many kinds of shark and this was the only one I saw with an octopus. My son also liked the pool with the manta rays, giant turtle and little sharks swimming about in it but I was worried if he leaned over too much he might fall inside of it. The only suggestions I have - The dolphin show would have been better without the lengthy video which was distracting - I'd rather only see the dolphins perform.  We had hoped there would be a sea lion show too like there is at the aquarium on Coney Island.The children's play area here was plain boring - I didn't get it at all  - a few rubber things that looked that octopus tentacles separated from the octopus and a table with crayons and one big piece of paper. My 5 year old son and I skipped the 4 D movies since the negative reviews of these movies on Yelp turned us off and also my son had had enough of 4D movies with water squirting you in the face and moving theater chairs during our recent trip to Universal Studios in Orlando.  P.S. We went at 10:00 a.m. given the warning in other reviews about crowds. The crowds start around 12:00 noon onwards. The National Aquarium was okay but could have had more inside to entertain you for the price you pay. We were done by 12:00 noon." "8/31/2010"
"4.0" "This is the best aquarium I've ever been to. There are only two minor reasons why it's not 5 stars, and I'll get to those later. This massive aquarium features tons of aquatic life, as well as land creatures from the rainforests of the world. It is very clean and easy to get around, although the walking distances are lengthy. There is a massive pool of sharks and sting rays that you walk over many times through the main exhibition. This is via elevators and walkways, as the main building is five stories. There is a daily dolphin show, which I didn't have time to partake in. The aquarium is composed of three buildings, the main exhibition in one, the dolphin show in another, and then a third building with exhibition space I believe to be temporary. However, the Australia exhibit is not worth your time. This is in the third building as of the time of this review. It dosen't cost any extra, but it's very short and shows pretty much the same stuff you find in the main exhibition, with a few exceptions. The other downside, the cost. It's about $21 for an adult to get in, and about $24 for the dolphin show on top of everything else. Otherwise, excellent aquarium and I recommend visiting if you find yourself within two hours of Baltimore with time to spare. I came while visiting Washington." "6/29/2007"
NA "pretty good for an aquarium, enough varieties so you won't get bored, and yet the pace is fast enough so you won't be overwhelmed." "8/9/2006"
