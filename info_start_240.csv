"4.0" "Not the best aquarium I've ever been to but still very, very nice.The amazon section and three finned turtle are probably my favorite areas.  The Jellies exhibit was fun but about half the size of the one at the Chicago aquarium.  They have a great deal where you can get a season pass as well as guest passes (which we partook in) so we will definitely be going again soon.We went on memorial day and it was crowded but not obscenely so.  In the reptile area we ended up skipping the tank because of the large crowds around them.Fun place, get the annual pass and just swing by for a few hours if you're a local (this also lets you skip the lines)." "6/6/2012"
"1.0" "This place rocks! But get there early before its too crowded. The exhibits are very nicely done. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. Shark tank was truly a sight to behold. To see great whites that close was amazing." "7/21/2014"
"5.0" "too expensive!!! 150.00 for a family of 4..." "8/27/2014"

"4.0" "Ok, so here's the story- I went down to Baltimore for the weekend of my birthday. I've never been there and Baltimore is around three and a half hours from me give or take. Anyways, I get down there Saturday morning, walk around a bit to a few other attractions then take a break to check into my hotel and drop off my bag. I then head down towards the Inner Harbor. Based on a suggestion made by a gentleman I spoke with at the visitor's center and my aunt, I decide to visit the aquarium.Admission is kinda pricey but inside, the aquarium is set in a really good layout. In the late afternoon when I went, there were lots of children watching the different fishes. There's a huge variety of fish inside and the setup is great. I especially liked the sharks and there's this huge tank full of sharks inside. Didn't really check out the gift shop or food here but I'm sure it's not cheap. It's really great for kids and kids at heart like me. Other than the hurting the admission put on my wallet, I can't complain. If you happen to be taking a cruise on the waterfront at night or across the harbor in Federal Hill, you can see the aquarium light up at night. Definitely recommend it for anyone who's going to Baltimore, especially those with kids." "3/10/2013"
"3.0" "Awesome place! But they do not allow strollers for kids so bring a carrier if you have infants, or you can use one of theirs. Try to go at off hours. I miss the dolphin shows which they no longer have." "9/24/2014"
"3.0" "I also visited here and the mall on the same school trip. There was an interesting, slightly cheesy  dolphin show that was alright, but, I don't remember anything incredibly notable. Maybe if I had been able to see the entire place that'd change." "4/23/2012"
"5.0" "Don't use their partner garage!!!  With the discount it's almost double the price if the garage 1 block over.  It's unbelievably crowded.  I'd go 2:45 or later to get some relief.  I love aquariums and heard this was a great one.  Really mediocre and pretty expensive for what it is.  It is a great way to spend the day if it's raining though." "6/3/2013"
"3.0" "Great place. I loved the Black Reef and the Shark tank. It was a lot of fun and though it is expensive I thought it was worth the money. There is a lot to do here and the place is huge!!!" "12/1/2013"
"5.0" "If you are staying in Baltimore and have never been, then you should go check it out. Be warned - it is very tourist trap-y. Not the best aquarium I have ever been, and certainly not for the prices that they charge. The Camden Aquarium has much more to offer at a much better price. The one exhibit that somewhat justifies the admission fee is the dolphin training session. My wife and I went here on our honeymoon this past weekend and caught the trainers demonstrating the tricks that they had taught the dolphins, which was very cute. It is definitely a good place for families, so if you have kids and want to keep them occupied for an afternoon, this is a good place to go." "4/15/2013"
"3.0" "I was 13 years old the first time I came here on a class field trip. It was fun and educational at the same time. Fast forward to age 31. I came here for the second time ever with my wife since we took the day off work to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. We received our tickets as part of our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore (great place, btw, see my review). We decided to upgrade the standard tickets to include the dolphin show ($3/person). We arrived 45 minutes before the dolphin show and started our visit of the place by starting backwards. The aquarium is laid out in pavilions labeled numerically. To avoid the crowd of people, we started from the rear. We also did this since the dolphin show would be opening its doors soon and we wanted to get a good seat.Lots to see and there are even handlers holding animals for you to see up close and even touch. My wife fell in love with the bearded dragon and wants one now. Hopefully, that desire will fade before she goes out and buys one.The dolphin shows was just as I remembered: cute and fun. The other exhibits were great: sharks, rainforest animals, rays, frogs, snakes, etc. The jellyfish near the dolphin section was a cool one to see.Definitely recommend it for anyone: kids, teens, young adults, and old adults." "1/25/2012"
"4.0" "Supposed to be one of the best in the nation? I don't think soGranted there are many floors but the space is soo small and it gets soo crowded. You can barely see the tanks, you have to stand in line most of the time and try to squeeze in to look at the fish.Some of the revolving doors move so fast! I can totally see a little kid gets whacked by it, definitely not kid friendly...." "5/16/2013"
"5.0" "We visited the Baltimore National Aquarium in February.  It was a great place to take the family while visiting the area.  We bought a membership; with a family of 6, it was less expensive than buying 6 admissin tickets and we got discounts on food and parking.  The exhibits were amazing!  Highlights:  the rainforest room and the jellyfish room.  Additionally, there were many interactive displays and opportunities to learn about the marine life.  On the downside, it is very crowded and at times hard to walk around for a good view, and if you are not a member you will have to wait for an assigned entrance time, even if you have a ticket.  Advice:  pack snacks because the food is very pricey." "4/7/2012"
"4.0" "I went to the National Aquarium after spending a few days in Baltimore attending a conference at the Convention Center. The aquarium is good, comparable to Shedd or Atlanta. It's not Sea World, so don't expect Shamu, but they do an excellent job with presentation and education. I would have rated it a solid 4, but it gets an emphatic extra star for one reason: they don't let strollers in!! This may be difficult for parents, but it's a god-send for those of us without infants. Seriously - I could walk around without inattentive parents hitting me with their overpacked strollers! There were a number of people there in wheelchairs, and it appeared they had a far easier time navigating than they would have in a sea of strollers (yay for being accessible!). If you're in Baltimore and have a free afternoon, definitely check out the Aquarium. And parents, don't worry, they have a stroller check at the entrance." "6/28/2013"
"4.0" "I don't think there is any real standard for an aquarium, which makes them difficult to review. Here's a quick breakdown of the aquarium. - If you stay at nearby hotels you can get a discount on your tickets. Our hotel was offering tickets for $24.99 a person.- We were able to walk to the aquarium from our hotel, but from a quick glance or two you should probably be prepared to deal with a less than stellar parking situation here.- I found the layout to be a bit confusing. We weren't handed a map of the aquarium at the entrance, which is something every other aquarium I've been to does. Luckily we were able to find some randomly hanging out on a folding table a few exhibits in.- We were there on a Friday and it wasn't full of children.The GOOD:- Lots of variety! - The rain forest is probably one of the most unique things you'll see in any aquarium.- Knowledgeable staff. Sometimes you can watch them feeding the animals and they will happily tell you all about it.- The location is beautiful!- You can see some of the exhibits from above.- The dolphin show! We showed up late, but it was cool and entertaining. And we didn't have to pay extra.The BAD:- A lot of that variety can be found in small tanks, and only one or two people can look at a time. - The shark exhibit was disappointing. I know that these types of things fluctuate, but I was so excited walking down the spiraling floor, only to see about three sharks swimming around in a very dark area.- Adding to the sharks, there wasn't any tunnels to walk through.- The food is way overpriced." "6/7/2013"
"3.0" "I spent a good portion of the afternoon with my husband just in awe and amazement by all the wonder of the exhibits anf of course, the main attraction of the huge aquarium. I def agree with Nicole L. to get the $30 ticket for acess to all shows.  I love the bottom level of th aquarium where it opens up to all marine life- dolphins, sting rays, dolphins, sharks, jelly fish, tropical fish, sea turtle (amputated flipper), plants...I can go on all day. Love the informative staff who actually takes the time to educate and talk to all visitors particularly fun facts about the animals! Our visit was concluded with a stop to the gift shop for souvenirs. I brought a coin purse, T-shirt, and jelly beans for the trip back home. Def a cool place to visit if you're visiting Baltimore!" "11/22/2011"
"2.0" "Ever since my wife and I purchased our Buddy 50 scooter about a month ago our world has really opened up. Now that we no longer have to worry about the expense and aggravation of parking in the city we're free to scoot to just about anywhere we want to go. On a recent day of playing hooky, my better half and I decided to take a trip to the National Aquarium in Baltimore. I've visited plenty of aquariums (Dallas, Washington DC, San Francisco to name a few) in my short time on this Earth and they've ranged from the truly sublime to the decidedly mediocre. Baltimore's rendition of the aquarium ranks somewhere in between.Most of the other reviews on here mention how expensive the admission fee is. I guess if you're lugging around a gaggle of screaming children and the gads of parental baggage that goes along with it things could get pricey. For my experience I thought the $56 it cost us (we went with the general admission +4D movie bundle at just about $28 a piece) was pretty reasonable. Being smart enough to pretty much avoid all downtown tourist attractions during the weekend summer months we decided to hit up the aquarium on a Monday morning. If our experience is any indication of how crowded this place gets on the weekends, I can't imagine anyone wanting to put themselves through the pain.We got into the building around 9am after purchasing our tickets on-site and the crowds didn't appear that bad; that is until we made our way deeper into the belly of the beast. For 9am on a Monday morning the place was a madhouse and I'm not going hyperbolic on you here. Whining kids, shuffling seniors with canes, lost foreigners babbling in their native tongues, giant groups clad in matching fluorescent green t-shirts, it was truly an agoraphobe's worst nightmare. I'm not quite to shut-in status yet, but places like this have me inching ever closer. If you have any problems with tight spaces of throngs of people everywhere you turn I recommend just buying Planet Earth on Blu-ray and staying home.On with the tour. Basically, the building is set up in five levels that have you wandering, roughly single-file up and then back down again through a series of mechanical people-movers and escalators. The Baltimore aquarium has the usual suspects like incessantly circling sharks, a big open tank with divers and manta rays swimming in interspecies harmony, maniacally grinning dolphins and plenty of artificial dioramas with their respective inhabitants. Some of the highlights are the tropical rainforest display at level 5 and the Australian experience which is actually housed in its own building. The jellyfish exhibit is also pretty cool if you're into that whole gelatinous no spine thing.The 4D movie that we purchased as a $3 add-on to our tickets  is definitely something best left to kids and adults less jaded than me. The theater holds about 200 people and is equipped with various special effects (vibrating chairs, fans, lighting, and a snow machine) to \"immerse\" you in the movie experience. The movie we saw was called Planet Earth: From Pole to Pole and it was a bit of a disjointed compilation of nature movie footage showing the changing of the seasons from winter to spring. The 3D was not very effective in this instance but the snow machines and blowing wind were pretty entertaining. If you've done similar things at Universal Studios or Disney skip it here lest you be disappointed.If there's one thing that did stand out in a positive way it would have to be the aquarium staff. Clad in blue golf shirts and nearly always wearing a smile (except for one staffer we found texting away up in the rainforest. You know who you are...) the aquarium staff appeared to be engaged, helpful, and friendly. It was a strange sight, but I think they were actually enjoying their jobs. I don't think I've ever witnessed anyone enjoying their job before, but I have to think that if I had this is what it would've looked like. Our aquarium experience lasted about three hours from start to finish and this included the 25 minute 4D movie. We made the up and down trip twice to visit a few things that were too crowded on our first pass, but most of this time was spent waiting. Be prepared to languish in slow-moving lines for your chance to peer into the various exhibits constantly mobbed by dozens of pediatric plecostomi and parents who seem to think that they're the only ones on the planet. It's rough and you'll want a shower when you get home but there are glimpses that'll pepper your day and help temper the ills with wonder. The Baltimore aquarium is not necessarily something I'd jump to do again it was a welcome diversion and something I'll remember, at least for a little while." "7/26/2011"
"4.0" "As far as aquariums go this one left me disappointed.  I am giving it two stars because I have been to many better aquariums.  The cost was pretty high for what you get.  Also the building is under construction and there's a little bit of a convoluted mess to getting around the building.  I also didn't like that the entire aquarium is indoors.  The aquarium was very crowded and I didn't like the setup of most of the building space although there were a few gems.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for some of the animals that spend their entire existence inside such as the puffins.  It was sad to see one puffin seemingly trying to get out of its small enclosure.  Some other visitors seemed clueless thinking the puffin was trying to be friendly to humans." "11/12/2012"
"2.0" "It's a very nice aquarium, but it was absolutely PACKED when we went, which did take away from it somewhat.  And it couldn't compete with the Georgia Aquarium, which we visited last year.  Even though it's an aquarium, probably my favorite part was the rainforest room.  It's a a very pleasant place, with birds and tamarinds roaming free.  But the best part was the two-toed sloth, which we saw on the move, crawling all over the place high above.  They're really neat animals, and the move in such a strange, fascinating way.  Plus it  was great during the winter to be in a warm, sunny place in the middle of the winter.The dolphins are probably the biggest attraction, and they are neat.  They've got a really great underwater viewing area, with big windows that give you a great view of the animals.  They've stopped doing the traditional dolphin shows, but they still put on a nice little demonstration.  There was other nice stuff as well - a neat jellyfish exhibit (although we've seen very similar ones elsewhere), a nice tropical fish tank, and many other nice tanks.  There are also big glass windows with nice views of Inner Harbor.  One of the main exhibits was closed due to renovations, however - the Blacktip Reef.  It's a very nice aquarium, although starting to get slightly dated and extremely crowded.  It is also absurdly expensive: $30 for an adult (we got them slightly cheaper from AAA - $27 each).  Still, we had a nice time there." "1/3/2013"
"5.0" "I know everyone in this area loves the aquarium but coming from aquariums like the ones in Atlanta and Chattanooga the National Aquarium felt cramped and outdated. All the displays are stuck in the 80's and visitors are simply put on a single file path to walk past the exhibits. This allows for no extra lingering at exhibits that are especially fascinating." "10/10/2013"
"3.0" "Nice...family fun. The line was around the corner and up the block. Yes, that long. We ended up joining because it just saved us money on the front end and leg standing time as well. The line was moving but standing in the heat makes you feel like nothing is moving. It was hot as hell out there the weekend 7/5 of the 4th. We hit everything we could inside that was included in the free area. We also checked out the sponge bob movie which needs to be much longer. I mean come on people. The interactive movie at Ripley's believe it or not beat this one out and it had a part 1 and 2. Yall definitely need to step it up on the movies. We went to see the dolphin show which ends extremely early. The last show should go at least an hour before the place closes. It ended pretty early and the place is huge. It takes you a minute to figure out where everything is at and how to walk through the whole building." "7/8/2014"
"2.0" "3.5 starsMuch smaller than I remembered, but the last time I went was when I was in second grade. Didn't get to watch the dolphin show, but love the inside-of-the-tank view you can get on the lower level. Enjoyed the jellyfish exhibit too, lots of variety. The upside down jellyfish were my favorite. Love how flexible they are with their times. \"Visitors may tour the Aquarium up to 90 minutes after closing time.\" I wish they had an open area where we can see some of the animals up close, and I don't mean just open tanks. For example, I would have liked to see the puffins up close. It was kind of sad seeing them through glass. Overall, loved the design of the multi level tanks, and don't forget to go down the ramp at the top level and follow it down the second level." "1/23/2014"
"5.0" "Wow. Not only are tickets expensive, parking is quite expensive too.The aquarium... is not a small one. But it's not a big one either. And they don't really have too much variety in terms of viewing. And it gets reaaaaaally crowded with all the folks who just will not stop taking pictures of every little thing in the tank. We literally had to wait  as people had some intense photoshoots.Honestly, wasn't too worth it. I expected a lot more from a \"national aquarium\"" "10/22/2011"
"1.0" "Fabulous aquarium!Comprised of several buildings, the aquarium complex has many wonderful sights to take in - from the dolphin observatory are and show, to the jellyfish exhibit, the rainforest / Australia atrium areas and of course, the big tanks of many different species of sea life. One of my favorite things was the area where you walk down a series of ramps to see sharks!! So cool :)" "10/21/2012"
"4.0" "I hadn't visited this aquarium in years, and in the meantime, I've been to some really good ones in other cities. I was shocked that this one seemed so poorly maintained.  The layout is confusing, and the crowd flow poorly managed/planned. It needs a major update and remodeling. I don't want to go back again. It's too expensive for a mediocre experience." "11/12/2012"
"4.0" "Skipped the dolphin show and 4d because we went in at 4:00 to avoid the crowds. Parked about a block away (omg, parking is expensive) and walked to the aquarium. Enjoyed a little bit of scenery as well as jellyfish advertising the aquarium on the walk over. Had ordered tickets online, so I went right up to the ticket machine, swiped my card, and got my tickets. Also stopped by the adjacent ATM (how convenient)...Walked in around 3:50 and went right in. Started with the rays (see pictures), went on to view the adjacent exhibits including the sharks. Watched the sharks swim around, took more pictures, moved on because it felt like that one shark kept swimming around me and giving me the evil eye...Went on to see the Australia exhibit and the jellyfish (see pictures), as well as saw some frogs, and tons more fish (including some local-ish displays).All in all, a recommended stop. I really haven't been to another aquarium that is quite up to par (that includes various other aquariums in the States as well as in London and Korea). The place has a good flow, even when it is crowded. Aside from some parents who let their children scream and run wild, it was a very enjoyable experience. No matter what exhibit you decide to start with, it's easy to make your way to every exhibit without getting lost.I think it's nice they hire kids (high school, possibly college students) as well as senior citizens, but around the 5:00 hour, the younger employees can be pretty unprofessional. Groups of them standing by random doors, swinging keys, gossiping, etc. right in front of all the people in the aquarium. Still, it's a must see in Baltimore!" "8/27/2009"
"5.0" "Nope, it's not cheap and yes, it's very busy on the weekends.  However, this aquarium has an amazing variety of wonderful things to see.  I particularly enjoyed the jellyfish exhibit and the Australia exhibit - be sure to not miss those! Be prepared to spend a million bucks on parking. 3hrs at a garage across the street cost $17, and the coupon from website/aquarium would have only saved a measly 3 dollars.  I recommend parking a bit further - that should be a tad cheaper I'd think." "6/14/2011"
"4.0" "I went last Thursday and had a great time as usual. The place has so many animals I could go everyday and be amused. I highly recommend it for dates and family time. I've been to museums all over the country and am always amazed at all the events they have in the aquarium and around the community, especially within the last year or two. Keep up the good work!!!" "5/11/2013"
"4.0" "The exhibits and interactive learning and demonstration items are wonderful.  The gift shop can use some lowering of their prices. The dolphin show wasn't all that great nor very long so I was disappointed with that.  (They use to be better when they actually charged money for the show.)   They also have IMAX shows, at least 2 shows going and there is a charge for that.The bathrooms are very clean.DO NOT go for food if you are a food snob.  Not much of a selection.  If you're not all that picky just get a burger to keep you going, then go to the many restaurants outside the aquarium to eat something nice.  If you are not a food snob you probably can easily find something to fill you up.  They are trying to improve the food but they need to have the food options improve on both sides of the building since it's set up like tower 1 and tower 2.Overall this is one of my favorite places to go.  Not too far of a drive to get there.IMPORTANT!!!  -They have places to drop off strollers if you prefer not to take them.-They have lockers you can rent for the day.  Make sure to bring quarters!!!  -Some parking garages you can get validations from the information desk.  -Friday seems to be the school field trip day so beware if you are planning on a Friday visit.  Best days are Monday-Thursday if you can get time off work.-If you get the membership the rates are discounted." "2/28/2013"
"3.0" "I've been to Aquarium's in a few different cities by this point, and I wasn't amazed by the National Aquarium in Baltimore.  Maybe I just held it to such high standards because of all the things I've heard about it, but there was just no 'awe-factor' at any point (except for maybe the Jellyfish area).The place is huge, went on a Saturday at 11am (I know this is when it starts getting busy, and everybody is right THIS PLACE GETS CRAZY PACKED).  There is a lot to do at this place and my problem wasn't with a lack of exhibits, it was more with the upkeep.  Little things, like the dolphin tank was just dirty glass with a pale-white wall, the \"show\" was just a person feeding them and talking about dolphins.  Don't waste your time, you're better off paying a little extra to go to the 4D Immersion show, don't want to ruin the experience but it is alot of fun. (especially if you're a little inebriated haha)The rainforest area is kind-of cool, it is set up like a legit rainforest but alot of the little creatures are hiding and cannot be seen unless you have some serious patience. (which can be hard when thousands of tourists are scurrying past you and pushing you out of the way to catch up 3 feet to the rest of their family).  All in all, this place can use some upgrades, but then again so can most places.  Go here with a game plan in mind (I just wandered around aimlessly) and don't make the same mistake I did and go during the \"busy times of 11am-3pm\" because the crowds are twice as bad as I thought.Remember, I'm 23 years old so this is from my perspective, an 8yr old might be able to saty the whole day here completely enthralled with the \"NEMO FISHHHH!!!!!!, NEMO FISHHHH!!!!!!!\".  Good luck!" "8/7/2012"
"4.0" "Nice aquarium and cool fish but they do not allow strollers in the facility.  The structure of the building makes it impossible for strollers but carrying around a baby who can't walk is no fun. They offer you a carrier to use but it still makes the visit a little less fun lugging your child on your back. I think it's a great aquarium for adults and children 3 and up." "1/13/2014"
"4.0" "Dolphins, sharks, Nemo fish, and other awesome animals. What more could you ask for? I love coming here at least once a year. I would come more, but it is a little expensive. And really, how many times can you see the same fish over and over? However, it's still a great place to visit with the family, or to kill an afternoon." "7/22/2011"
"5.0" "We paid $18.12 ea. on Friday after 5. The aquarium was good place to visit with kids. We used parking structure crossed st. from the aquarium b/c they offer $5 off with validation. We paid $19 for the parking." "7/25/2014"
"3.0" "I had so much fun here! The sharks are so awesome. They had so many it was great to see them so close to notice the differences. A great variety of fish and great facts about them. The jelly fish are so cool. Kids had fun too. Lol ...do enjoy." "1/18/2014"
"3.0" "I have not been here since a class trip in 1997. Dare I say that not much has changed? The building itself is impressive from the outside and I felt the excitement to see all the marine life. The Australia exhibit was the highlight for me. The kookaburras were cracking up while we were walking through and the rainbow lorikeets were gorgeous. I didn't see any frilled lizards, unfortunately. I felt the staff was 50/50: 50% marine enthusiasts who were friendly and informative, and the other 50% were derelicts lurking in the corners. We spent a good four hours there, taking our time throughout the exhibits. Signs stated they closed at 6:30 but by 4:30, you could tell the workers were over it for the day and were not the least bit helpful. There was a special event being set up and it was super unclear where to go for the damn jellyfish exhibit. To get there, you had to go through a ton of catering people, chairs laying all over, no signs pointing you in the right direction. The jellies were really cool, so were worth the hassle to get to. I find a lot of the other reviews deduct stars for silly things. How much would you prefer the admission to be? $2? This place costs so much to maintain. There are also complaints of the escalator stairs supporting one person per stair at a time, how it's laid out like a maze, etc. This is obviously to control the crowds. How many people would you prefer ride next to you on an escalator? There are, understandably, a lot of goons rolling through here from all over the world so I prefer to take my time and not have my personal space compromised if at all possible. I enjoyed my visit and feel that's it is one of the more worthwhile things to do while in the harbor area." "8/30/2011"
"5.0" "This place is $30 and they don't even have penguins!! They have a dolphin show, but  other aquariums cost way less and have that and more. There are a bunch of exhibits, but for me, the price really killed it." "11/25/2012"
"3.0" "I am a HUGE fan of the Aquarium.  The location of the National Aquarium is perfect to spend the day at the inner harbor.  There is a bunch of choices for lunch if you choose not to eat inside the Aquarium... Houlihans, Chipolte, a few little dock bars/restaurants, and for the fabulous visitors... McCormicks and Schmicks or Ruth Chris's steakhouse.Now, the Aquarium is sooo much fun.  They had very cool fish, sharks, stingrays, seahorses, frogs, turtles, birds, ducks, dolphins,etc.  They gave a little bit of info on the display at each exhibit.  One of the things I enjoyed most was watching the kids in awe.  Nothing better.It was $35/adult and Children $22.  It's not a cheap visit but well worth it to me.  A few important things to keep in mind:1.  Entry is on a time system.  You don't just get in line and go in.  To manage the number of visitors going through at once, they group people together throughout the day.  Plan accordingly.  2.  There are discount coupons available if you google National Aquarium coupons.  The coupon avail at the time of my visit was for $4 off the $25 parking fee (Wow, now that's generous).  aqua.org/visit/baltimore…3.  The fastest way to visit is to book your ticket online so you don't have to wait in line to get your ticket.   4.  Download a map of the aquarium.  aqua.org/visit/baltimore…5.  Visit during the week when the traffic is lower.  6.  Go early.  It opens at 8:30.... get there as close to opening as possible to avoid the lines that grow as the day does.7.  Plan on spending 3-4 hours at the Aquarium.  Take your time to really find each of the hidden fish/frogs/turtles, etc.in each exhibit.8.  Wheelchair accessible.  The kids will love this and traveling without them? You will love it too!" "8/18/2013"
"4.0" "This museum was good but not great. Here are some positive aspects:Ticketing: While we were disappointed that we couldn't buy tickets online for the same day, purchasing them at the aquarium wasn't a big deal. We arrived at 1130 and asked for a 2pm entrance. We wanted to see a 4D show and the Dolphin show and they gave us times that accommodated our visit. Coat/stroller check:  this seems very well managed and worth the two dollars per coat. Tip: if you have a stroller, it is free to check and they let you put your coats on the stroller for free. Areas in need of improvement:Even with the timed tickets, it seemed a bit crowded.  It was difficult to get to some of the smaller exhibits. The 4D show was about 20 minutes long. I don't know exactly what I expected, but I expected it to be a bit longer. I felt the dolphin show was a bit weak. The announcer was difficult to understand. The dolphins were very good but the human component of the show could be improved. Finally, there is just a lot of wear and tear here. Having said all this, our kids had a great time here and we will come back in a few years." "2/11/2012"
"4.0" "We spent about 5 hours exploring the 3 buildings of the National Aquarium. It had been a while since our kids had visited an aquarium, so we spent much of our time at the underwater exhibits. We arrived early, which helped us get around more easily before the crowds arrived. The rainforest was interesting, but with limited places to stand, we were forced to move through the exhibit rather quickly. The jellyfish exhibit was incredible. We all enjoyed watching an IMAX movie, even if it was SpongeBob. The National Aquarium has been an outstanding place for years, and it remains such a place." "7/12/2014"
NA "This was my first visit to a real aquarium - before, I had only visited aquarium areas in zoos.  Yes, it is not cheap.  But zoos aren't cheap either.  We opted for the main ticket + dolphin access (they were not doing the dolphin show due to the birth of the new babies) for $27.95/each.  We got lucky and were able to score the last tickets for the 11:30 dolphin access at 10:15; when we exited around 2 o'clock, they were completely out of dolphin access tickets.  So if you want to see the dolphins, you might want to think about buying your tickets online to guarantee your spot (it's 1.95/ticket to do that).We spent 45 minutes perusing the Australian exhibit and the jellyfish before lining up for the dolphins at 11.  It was plenty of time to see both exhibits - and the Australian exhibit isn't ridiculously hot & humid (the sign on the door scared me a bit due to asthma concerns).  The dolphins were definitely a highlight.  Instead of the show, they talked a lot about the dolphins and then showed us some of their training techniques.  The dolphin trainers did an EXCELLENT job working with the never-ending-questioning coming from the many children in the audience.  They did allow a few children to participate as volunteers toward the end and I think it was a highlight of their trip.Afterwards, it took approximately 2 hours to tour Pier 3.  It's actually not that large, but we were there during peak times and the crowds were crazy.  I most enjoyed the rays and the rain forest section on the top floor.  The education parts were excellent - the info boards were well done and easy to understand for many age levels.Would I go again?  Probably not without taking someone who hadn't been or until they add something new.  But I'm glad that I went!"
