"1" "3.0" "The inner harbor is nice. There are plenty of shops and restaurants as well as a couple of shopping plazas. It is not a breathtaking view but it is a nice walk. The biggest attraction within the Inner Harbor is the National Aquarium. As a child, I remembered loving the aquarium. However, it does not hold up as well now that I am an adult. It is great for children because they have a lot of fish. However, it all starts looking the same once you have seen a few exhibits. The aquarium does have a good amount of sharks which you can get an up close look at through the glass of the tanks. The biggest attraction within the aquarium is the dolphins. If you go to the dolphin pools at the scheduled trainings, there are shows where the dolphins will do tricks such as flips and splashing the audience. It is definitely the best part of my visit.However, it is not cheap admission as it is $34.95 for an adult and $21.95 for children. It is also an additional $5 per person if you want to see a 4D movie. One of the movies is Happy Feet. I tried to buy tickets for the aquarium on Saturday around 1 PM. However, tickets were sold out till 5 PM so I went back on Sunday. As the aquarium is popular, you have to make sure you get there as soon as possible to buy tickets.If you are visiting Baltimore for work or vacation, please see my guide for the city: rookerville.com/2013/08/…" "11/7/2014"
"2" "4.0" "I'm a little disappointed. Thought it would be better.  You can do the tour in the whole aquarium in like 2/ 3 hours. Also it seems that they don't have a dolphin show. The forest like section it is prettt cool though. Camden Aquarium in New Jersey is much better and cheaper and you can pet the penguins, sharks, sting rays, etc." "3/13/2015"
"3" "5.0" "This was fun--tickets are certainly not cheap and I also really wanted to see otters or seals or sea lions and they are really limited to mostly fish and some sharks and jelly fish. But what they did have was cool and very well presented--worth the money.  The staff is also quite knowledgable, and it's a an area of Baltimore that, albeit touristy and pricey, can also be fun to walk around in." "11/13/2014"
"4" "4.0" "pretty neat aquarium.  actually I loved it.  it's different from others I've been to.  the newly opened touch tide pool is a huge plus as that's what I look forward to in any aquarium.  the shark exhibit was pretty awesome and huge.  I liked the different levels and everything was practically indoors so it's available in every season." "6/10/2015"
"5" "3.0" "I've been to the Aquarium four or five times in the past four years of being in Baltimore. It's always a good time! I've never actually paid full-price for the ticket because that seems a bit too pricey. The Fridays after 5 deal is fantastic and the crowds really aren't that bad! I think they raised the price for $8 to $12 but that's still a steal!There's a great variety of exhibits from local to tropical, it's always fun to walk around and check everything out. The new Black Coral Reef exhibit was pretty cool and really beautiful although I thought it would be bigger. Oddly enough, I also love going into the non-water exhibits like the rain forest and the Australia one which I hadn't seen until my most recent visit. Someday I'll have to go to the dolphin show because that looks so cool!The Aquarium is definitely a Bmore site not to be missed!" "3/24/2014"
"6" "4.0" "First time visiting the National Aquarium. It's a decent place with a few floors (can't remember exactly how many), with tons of sharks! It's a great place for family and it can be a great 1-2 hours activity. There is no more dolphin show, which is replaced by the dolphin exhibit, to stop housing these animals in captivity according to their CEO. The ticket price is pretty high. If you want to save some money, it's much cheaper to make the visit in Friday evening, which cost only $12 rather than $35. There are some street parking in that area, or you can park at the garage for higher cost." "1/10/2015"
"7" "5.0" "I haven't been here since I was a kid but even as an adult it's still mesmerizing. I was a tad disappointed seeing as I was looking forward to penguins and otters-but I think I was getting my venues mixed up. They do have dolphins which is neat.The new shark exhibit is awesome. It also showcases a lot of animals indigenous to the MD area, and then other exhibits show Australia, Amazon, and the Pacific Reefs. There are plenty of animals and fish to keep anybody occupied.I would skip the \"4D immersion film\" if we went again-It was short and not amazing. It was an extra $5, so nothing insane, but I was expecting a little more than a short 3D movie where they randomly spray you with water and have bubbles and vibrating chairs. I didn't know they validate parking if you park in a particular garage-we went to the Science Center across the Harbor earlier-but it would have been nice to know ahead of time to save the $18 in parking fees. There's a large gift shop, really nice deluxe cafe and coat check as well. I believe they also do overnight/immersion trips for those looking for a more in depth experience. General adult admission isn't cheap-$35, but I also believe a good portion of funds goes to conservation effort.I love coming to any zoo/aquarium-even as an adult-but the amount of kids that were amazed by the tropical fish makes the trip worth it :D" "5/9/2014"
"8" "4.0" "While visiting Baltimore we decided to visit this aquarium. Although it was very pricey, we really enjoyed it! There was a lot to see and the layout was unique. My kids loved every part of it. The sharks and the dolphin show were the top hits. They have a fun rainforest section to walk through and a cool jellyfish area. I love the location of it. It is in the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore. It is within walking distance of some great hotels, shops, and restaurants. Love this area! They offer 4D movies, but we ran out of time. Plan to spend a few hours there if you want to experience it all." "9/11/2014"
"9" "4.0" "Fantastic place to take your family and see the sea life. They have vast of different sea creatures, fish and dolphin!!!  Clean and well layout so you won't miss anything. The Australia side isn't much though and they do not allow stroller. So you better have a backpack baby carrier if your kid can't walk or run around." "6/10/2015"
"10" "4.0" "This is a fun aquarium, and well organized, especially for large groups. (Chaperoning a large group of kids, it was easy to make meeting locations  at the end of each section. Also, for the most part, you follow one designated path through the whole aquarium.) Watching the dolphins and their trainers was entertaining and educational. I also really liked the jellyfish exhibit." "6/1/2014"
"11" "4.0" "We love to visit the aquarium! We ended up buying a season pass because it is $130 for a couple, which works out to be less than the cost of two visits for two people. The pros: The dolphins! The black tip reef tankThe rest of the exhibits Reasonably priced food($9 for a cheeseburger and fries, $7 for a panini with fries)4D movieClose location to the harbor- leave and come back! The cons: Parking, but it is a problem for everything in the inner harbor- my suggestion go early and find street parking or look for the $13 lot. It is always crowded on weekends  I do have a couple tips before I end the review. Arrive early in the day because you can exit(get your hand stamped) and return. Bring a reusable water bottle- they have stations to fill them near the bathrooms. Throw a few small things of crackers in the bottom of your bag in case you get hangry. The gift shops sell snacks too and you can often get $2 snacks on the clearance rack. Enjoy your visit!" "9/28/2014"
"12" "4.0" "Went on a family trip- 5 adults.  A bit expensive but we all had a great time." "11/21/2014"
"13" "5.0" "Crowded for sure, but a good time. Buy tickets online for your preferred time slot or be prepared to wait on line." "4/8/2015"
"14" "3.0" "If you plan on going more than twice a year, get a membership.  It's tax deductible and the perks are great.  We have used our membership so much this last year and loved every trip.  The member only evenings have no crowds and plenty of room for my little guy to run around without disturbing everyone.  The staff is incredible!  They are friendly, engaging and just plain fun.  We feel so welcome and wanted here.  They do not do a dolphin show anymore, but more on an educational experience with a little bit of fun thrown in.  Yes, there is still a splash zone :)My only complaint is parking!  The garages near by are expensive even when they do validate a portion of it for you." "2/15/2014"
"15" "3.0" "I took my girlfriend here on a Sunday after noon. It cost $69.00 for the both of us, we didn't pay the extra $5 for the 4D movie Once we got in there was a long line...wasn't sure what it was for but everyone was waiting on that line so we jumped on. The line is for a souvenir photo you take behind a green screen (in the photo fish will pop up behind you) - we didn't want a photo so there was no point in waiting in that line. So of ya don't want to buy a souvenir photo with fake fish behind you....just skip the line if there is one.Once we got inside, there were little Demond's running around everywhere (kids under age 10) it's hard to see some exhibits with the amount of kids just running around, not even looking at the exhibit...but it's an aquarium what do ya expect.  We still saw everything and it was a really. So many different fishes, tons of different colors and sizes. Sharks that looked pissed as hell, with razor sharp teeth. The end of the aquarium takes you to the dolphin exhibit. One of the best parts. I specifically wanted to come here so my girlfriend and I could watch the dolphin show iv read so much about.WARMING: there is no dolphin show. Aparently they stopped doing it about a year ago. They don't tell anyone that though. You walk into a big seaworld-like stadium and everyone takes a seat, some seats labeled \"splash zone\" this gets everyone extremely excited for a show but there is none. You can still watch the dolphins swim. There are also viewing areas under the tank.  At random times they feed the dolphins and they will do tricks and what not, so that's kinda like a show but it's only for about 5 minutes. A lot of people walk in excited to see a show, wait 10 minutes and then ask when the show starts...that's when a staff member breaks the news that there is no show : /  we we're among the many people that waited and waited...at least we got to see them do a couples cool tricks while feeding.Overall the aquarium was a really cool date. Tons of walking, so be prepared for that especially if you have little kids" "2/25/2014"
"16" "5.0" "This is a 4-star Aquarium; but the experience is 2-stars at best. It's quite possible that children outnumber adults here on the weekends. It doesn't matter if you go first thing in the morning or later in the day (as they recommend) - National Aquarium feels like a glorified day care center, and it's not pleasant if you don't have children. Aside from kids running around crashing into each other and you, there are people with those giant child-carrier backpacks that smack everyone within a 5-foot radius every time they turn around. If the National Aquarium offered some kind of adults-only \"after hours\" event where you could explore the exhibits while sipping wine, I'd happily pay $35 for that because like I said, the aquarium is actually quite impressive. But to pay that much money for what you get? Nope. Sorry. Just not worth it for us childless folks." "2/10/2014"
"17" "5.0" "Enjoyed our visit immensely. A little pricey ($34/ adults) but a neat place where you could spend a whole day. Kids will love it." "1/1/2015"
"18" "2.0" "One of the must see/places to visit in Baltimore. Be aware that they don't allow strollers. The also have a family room/baby feeding room by the blue bubble tubes at the beginning of the tour." "8/1/2015"
"19" "4.0" "I /hate/ this aquarium. I've been to a lot of aquariums and I found this one to be disappointing, considering its the National aquarium.Its crowded. Very crowded. Especially during the summer and weekends. Its expensive, which is acceptable, plus having to pay for parking on top of that. I like expensive things, but this isn't one of them.Other than the crowds, the exhibits are pretty standard. I'm kinda disappointed they don't have it set up to pet the sting rays." "3/28/2014"
"20" "1.0" "Who doesn't love the fishes? The Baltimore National Aquarium is a true celebration of all life under the sea (and, with the current Australia and rainforest exhibits, life on land, too!) At $35 for adults, ticket prices can seem a little hefty, especially for those of us used to all the free Smithsonian museums (including the National Zoo!) but if you haven't had a chance to experience the Baltimore Aquarium, I think it's definitely worth the pricetag.The Aquarium is laid out with a specific path to follow through all of the exhibits on marine life. The main exhibit right now is an artificial coral reef they're created called Blacktip Bay -- illustrating what life is like in real coral reefs. Very cool stuff, and with the educational speech given by one of the employees at the Aquarium, I'm more educated on coral reefs and underwater life than ever!At the very top floor is a rainforest exhibit which includes sloths and tropical birds -- you have to hike up some stairs to get to it (I think maybe they are renovating the floor in between, which is why you have to take the back stairwell right now?) but it's worth the trip. Be forewarned though, if you visit the aquarium in Winter all bundled up, you will be PEELING the layers off in the rainforest room! It's hot as balls in there!Other cool things includes the puffin exhibit (squeeee!), the various poisonous frogs (how can something so tiny and adorable want to kill me so bad?!), the moving exhibit space which currently houses an ode to the jellyfish (I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy!), and the dolphin training area. I know dolphin stuff is kind of controversial, but it really is pretty cool to see everything they can do.The only reason I am not giving the National Aquarium a full 5-stars is because I do find it kind of pricey, and beacuse I've been to the Georgia Aquarium which, if you think the Balmer Aquarium is impressive, hot damn, you haven't seen nothin' yet. 4.5 stars though, and most definitely worth a trip! Can't wait until my niece is a couple years older and I can experience it all over again through her eyes. :)" "1/22/2014"
"21" "4.0" "Rented a minivan so we could take visiting relatives and the chitlins. Drove forever. Parked three blocks away and walked over. Realized we forgot the tickets at home. Ugh! Considered buying more. Arrived and queued. Tickets would have run close to $150 for three adults and one preschooler. Then we noticed signs that STROLLERS AND FOOD ARE NOT ALLOWED. With a cruising baby and a preschooler, this killed it for us. We headed to the B and O Railroad museum, which had FREE admission, and was beautiful and kid-friendly. There are indoor and outdoor play areas, too!" "9/25/2014"
"22" "2.0" "Great place to go both for a date or with family. A lot of different types of fish, sharks, turtles, and small reptiles. If you can go during the day on a weekday i would recommend it because it does get quite busy at nights and weekends. If you want to save some money since it is 34.95 per person i would go on fridays 5pm or after when they do the 12 dollar special per person, here is the site. aqua.org/visit/baltimore…Overall it is a lot of fun and in the last level there is a jungle themed area with some birds and a couple of sloths. Definetely recommend doing the friday special but just know ahead of time it will be extremely packed. So make sure you go early to avoid the large lines and make sure you buy the tickets online." "12/29/2014"
"23" "5.0" "I went with my boo, we are from Philly. We tired to order our tickets online and the system kept crashing so I had to run to the aquarium (luckily it was a couple of blocks away from our hotel) to get in at a good time. I got us tickets after 5pm Friday evening HALF PRICE($17:50) Coming in the place was PACKED! We felt like tuna in a humid tuna can. Mostly the place was dark and we couldn't really enjoy the fishes. Little kids running everywhere. The only thing we enjoyed was the {The4D monster of Deep movie} which was $5. I wish we could have just went to see the short film. Plus it would have really helped to have receive a map upon coming to the aquarium. We did have a great time chatting to the pizza guy and talking in the cafeteria Sweet potato fries & cheese pizza (which tasted like the frozen kind) smh we basically paid the aquarium for we to have a fantastic conversation. PLEASE MANGMENT limit the amount of people you let in, give out maps at the entrance, brightens up the place, & a couple of air conditioners wouldn't hurt. We won't be coming back again. Total $45.00 couldn't been $80 dollars! #GodFavoredUS" "4/3/2015"
"24" "3.0" "Had a great time here yesterday! The 4D show was a fun add-on for $5/pp, well worth it to us! Great interactive audience special effects in the theater! We got sprayed with water unexpectedly but it was funny. There are 5 levels to explore. And make sure you park in their recommended lot & take your ticket inside to get validated for $5 off. Great for kids!" "12/27/2014"
"25" "3.0" "This place is kind of tough to review. I've been here three times; nearly 5-10 years between each visit. While kind of cool, it hasn't really changed much and is beginning to show it's age (as am I lol.) I wouldn't recommend this place at full-ticket price.   You'll see sharks. You'll see fish. You'll even see a three-finned turtle. While pricey, it may be worth it if you have little kids. Every now and then, you can find some deals to lower the entry fee. I would hold out for those. It really is the kind of place you visit once every 10 years or so." "8/4/2014"
"26" "5.0" "I thought the aquarium was just alright considering for 2 people we paid $70.  We took my 2 year old daughter and we all enjoyed the exhibits. Rainforest was just a bad hair day waiting to happen. The children's section was not so great. I've seen better for kids. The dolphins could also use improvements.  You just sit there and watch but the back tanks was were the action was." "4/20/2014"
"27" "4.0" "Great experience, I went there with my wife and kids and it was great the visuals are amazing my son was captivated and the tour was very informative the only thing that was not so good was the food options but still a great place and fun to spend the day in, highly recommended." "5/3/2015"
"28" "1.0" "This is probably the best aquarium I have been, but like so many reviews the cost ($35) just blows you away and leaves you with a 'I've been raped' feeling.I suggest you visit this pace as early as possible to avoid crowds and you will also be treated to a feeding frenzy exhibit.The tropical jungle in the ceiling is awesome.I have been to aquariums in Boston and Cincinnati, which were much more affordable but did not have as much as this aquarium. Biggest downfall of this place is they allow it to get way too crowded to be able to view." "7/27/2014"
"29" "5.0" "Very Disappointed, this use to be very nice. Besides the High ticket cost YOU get your picture taken before you go in I thought cool. You get that on the way out then we entered the reef area where there were stingrays, two small sharks a couple of dory's from finding Nemo and that big turtle Nice went back a little there were two bigger sharks that's it for that exhibit saw some jelly fish waited for a dolphin show never happened they just explained how the were related and how you can tell them apart no show happening that particular time.went to the reptile exhibit saw some crocs, birds,fish.Overall that was it Nothing like it use to be The National Aquarium is Nothing more than a Gift Novelty Shop and Cafe. They charge you for the picture you take in the beginning those were to High! Just a waste of Money to come here the old aquarium was Much Better!" "4/13/2015"
"30" "2.0" "We love the National Aquarium. When we can't get there, we often watch the Shark Cam (seriously, look it up) sort of in the background of doing other things. We recently slept over with the sharks there, and can't recommend this highly enough.  We got to hear the frogs that only sing at night in the rain forest exhibit and watch how the animals behaved differently as darkness fell all over the aquarium.  We also got to see a lot of things behind the scenes and get to know some amazing people who work with the animals in a variety of capacities.  And it wasn't prohibitively expensive.  Seriously amazing.  We also got to be there when the window to the dolphin tank was opened first thing in the morning, which was incredible - the dolphins came by and were extremely curious about the changing \"human exhibit\" they had to see.We're also extremely happy that, far from being a static organization, this place is changing how it handles its exhibits in order to make itself a place to learn about the importance of conservation and respect for our oceans and the creatures that live in them.  Don't expect a Sea World type of dolphin show - and DO take the time to learn more about why this change is a good thing." "6/22/2014"
"31" "2.0" "Strollers and wheelchairs need not apply, but this is a great destination for people who can walk.      I don't have to list the many pros of this place; look at other reviews or their website for a laundry list of cool things about the aquarium. However my review offers what I feel is some seriously useful information that I wish I would've had before I visited this past Sunday. I may have reconsidered, had I known.     I have two main complaints.     My first complaint is the complete lack of accessibility.           If you are in a wheelchair or have a child in a stroller, you will feel like an intrusion and an afterthought in an establishment that begrudgingly does the bare minimum to make it possible, let alone convenient, for you to enter.  In fact, strollers are not even allowed! So unless your child has a special need that can get you an exception, you better make sure your kid is comfortable walking. Otherwise I hope you have really strong arms!      Some pie-in-the-sky architectural artiste wannabe decided to  needlessly lay this place out in a very \"futuristic\" way, resembling the ugly love-child of the Guggenheim and a DNA molecule. The exhibits are in a series of round balconies separated by an open central hub. To get from one floor to the next, you'll need to take a motorized walkway across one of the gratuitous footbridges spanning the hub. They aren't staircases, though; in fact, these are moving ramps! You'd think this WOULD be perfect for non-walkers... if they were only 6 inches wider. As it is, the sci-fi dreamers in charge of designing this place made the boneheaded and insensitive decision to build these ramps so narrowly that they are inaccessible to the very people who need them! Why why why why why? Why would anyone do this?      Wheelers will be stuck using the elevators which are inconspicuously tucked away in corners near the ENTRANCES, rather than the exits, of the exhibits. So while walkers have the privelege of following a logical path through the exhibits and up to the next level in an orderly fashion, the second class citizens on wheels will have to travel against the flow of foot traffic to get back to the elevators. This may not sound so bad when you're reading it, but I dare you to try it on a busy Sunday afternoon here. When this place gets as crowded as it does (which is VERY), you will find yourself fighting crowds and saying \"Excuse me\" more or less constantly, as if you're apologizing for simply existing there.     Not only does this smack of a new form of de facto segregation, it is also simply a poor layout which creates more congestion for everybody. Beyond that, some areas (such as the upper portion of the rainforest exhibit) are entirely inaccessible. Our trip was constantly inconvenient, often frustrating, occasionally humiliating, and a lot less fun than it should have been.      I don't believe we will be returning, and I DEFINITELY don't recommend this place to anyone who requires a wheelchair or a special-needs stroller. My second complaint is the dolphin tank.     While the dolphins appear healthy and the water appears clean, the tank is small, perfectly unadorned and dull. Considering that they don't even do performances anymore, there is no need to keep dolphins at all. They may as well set these poor creatures free from their sensory depriving prison and then renovate that area for other purposes. Instead, they remain in this tank doing NOTHING at all, other than going through the motions and justifying the aquarium's ability to say that they have dolphins.It's pointless and cruel. I found the dolphin area to be uninteresting and depressing." "6/30/2014"
"32" "3.0" "Only took us an hour to go through the entire aquarium, and we were not rushing through. There just isn't enough to do in this aquarium to justify the cost. Don't bother going here." "7/5/2015"
"33" "5.0" "wow this place was lame. unless you purchase the 4d movie experience, this place is a snoozefest for $35. I came on a Thursday afternoon and did not purchase the 4D experience option. There's three main sections 1) Australian swamp creatures, 2) a shark tank with Finding Nemo type sea creatures, 3) dolphin area that may or may not have a show/feeding time (there's no schedule or at least that's what i was told.)I walked through in about twenty minutes and I was really disappointed. Their staff wasn't very informative either, it just felt like a very melancholy type place and I'm out $35 bucks." "1/29/2015"
"34" "3.0" "Omg this place was Awesome!  Spent the entire afternoon viewing everything the aquarium had to offer, spectacular. When in Baltimore it's a must especially if you have children or a child at heart." "4/6/2015"
"35" "2.0" "3 1/2*The aquarium was way too hectic the day I went (maybe it was my fault) but waiting on line for 1.5 hours in the cold is not my idea of fun.  Anyway, the aquarium itself is nice.  My favorites were the special jelly fish exhibit, the sea horses, and the sharks.   Try to go on a day when they are having a special, the regular ticket prices are pretty steep." "12/17/2013"
"36" "4.0" "The place is small and could be finished in less than 2 hours.  The ticket price is ridiculous at $35 a pop. Not a place to visit more than once every 10 years." "4/10/2015"
"37" "4.0" "I enjoyed the aquarium. There are many exhibits and it's not just fish. They have amphibians, dolphins, and some reptiles too. Weekends they seem to be busy and full of families so beware. I also suggest buying a membership as you can visit for a whole year and you can buy discounted tickets for friends." "9/26/2014"
"38" "4.0" "Took my son here today and he loved it! The exhibits aren't half bad. I wish they had more open water exhibits like the main one when you walk in. I feel bad for the dolphins, they're just in a big empty pool/tank. They seem bored. The staff is SUPER friendly which I love. They're also great with children. Especially the gentlemen that works at the stroller check. You can't bring your stroller, but they offer awesome backpacks to carry your littles in. We chose not to use one, but they looked easy. We'll be back when he's older!" "9/4/2014"
"39" "5.0" "Massively sized aquarium which has something for everyone to explore!  I especially loved viewing the Tropical rainforest which mimicked an outdoor setting  and the Amazon Rainforest.  Now for the negative , this place was swarming with people on a Sunday which made it difficult to read the information about the exhibits . The $34.95 admission was also a bit high but we were told that you can go in and out the aquarium . All in all, it was quite the experience . Just be wary coming here on Sunday!" "8/17/2014"
"40" NA "An outstanding attraction that is filled with amazing exhibits and species. It was busy when we were there but the layout of the Aquarium ensures continuous movement throughout. Amazing experience for children and the 4D movie is a must. We chose the Salmon Running but Spongebob would be great for kids. Well worth the money. Allow 4 hours minimum." "7/31/2014"
