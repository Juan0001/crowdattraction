"5.0" "I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong the aquarium is nice but not what I expected. I have taken my kids to the Camden Aquarium a couple times now and choose to drive 2 1/2 hours to Baltimore to show them what I thought was a bigger, better Aquarium. I was wrong. A lot small and not as many fish / animals. Defiantly a place to stop when in Baltimore but I would not travel just to visit." "7/8/2013"
"5.0" "Before we even stepped inside, my husband and I became members - and I'm so glad we did!  We plan to visit and bring friends often!  Plus I'm looking forward to taking advantage of the member event.   I'm typically tough on aquariums because I grew up going to the New England Aquarium in Boston - which is fabulous.  So the fact that I like the National Aquarium in Baltimore so much really speaks volumes.  Plan to go early and take your time.  It does get crowded... but that's because it is a wonderful aquarium and many people want to see all the amazing creatures, critters and animals.  The area is easy to get to and park.  And because you are in Inner Harbor there are plenty of other things to see and do -- make a day of it and enjoy!" "7/7/2012"
"4.0" "Definitely a \"must visit\" if you're in Baltimore.  One of the best aquariums I've ever been to.  Their collection is amazing.  The only complaint I have with it is that they don't do a Dolphin show year round." "2/8/2013"
"5.0" "This aquarium was better than I expected. I really enjoyed all of it. I enjoyed the 4-D movie although way too short for the price. The dolphin show was good, although this isn't SeaWorld. A really fun place to spend the day!" "3/22/2012"
"5.0" "The National Aquarium in Baltimore feels like a second home to me; I've visited it more times than I can count over the last six years and it's been a remarkable experience every time.  From accidentally stumbling across an archer fish feeding in the Australia exhibit to spotting a slot in the trees of the rain forest section or getting mesmorized by the dolphins at play, the Aquarium is fun place to spend a couple of hours with friends and family.  I must admit that I've always managed to avoid the crowds by following their tip to visit on weekdays or on weekends and holidays before 11 a.m. or after 3 p.m.  If you're local, I'd recommend signing up for one of the memberships." "6/5/2013"
"5.0" "Good news! The aquarium is still great.Bad news... you can no longer upload pics to Facebook for free." "10/17/2011"
"3.0" "This is by far the best aquarium ever. The only problem is the school crowds but what do you expect when going to an aquarium. Be prepared for a journey because not everything is properly signed as where to go but hey I like adventures. Also the lighting is pretty dark but makes it kinda spooky. I love this place." "4/20/2013"
"3.0" "While visiting boyfriend's family in York, PA, we were trying to find an activity to do with his two young neices. The original plan was to take the train to Philadelphia, but because it was over 100 degrees that weekend, we ended up driving over to Baltimore instead. Naturally, the best indoor kid activity was the National Aquarium. I had heard so many great things about this aquarium over the years, so I was pretty excited. However, I was disappointed that it did not live up to the hype. At $30 per person, I expected to be blown away. However, many of the tanks were not well kept and the variety of sea life was pretty generic. There were some parts of the aquarium that were much nicer than others and when visiting a place and paying that much money, I'd like to see some uniformity or continuity when it comes to quality. Highlights for me included the shark section which was large, dark, and moody. I also enjoyed their jelly fish section and their cool simulated rain forest. However, everything else was just \"OK\" and the 4-D theater show was a total let down. The show was basically 20 minutes of a Planet Earth episode with the added 4-D surprises like mist and a part where the shark pokes you in the back (which actually hurt a lot). I also got a little depressed watching the dolphins...mostly because I have watched The Cove and these dolphins didn't look too happy. This place is worth a visit if you're with small children and need something to do indoors...however, for a clever date or to explore some great sea creatures, I can't highly recommend it. The Aquarium of the Pacific and the Monterey Bay aquarium have got them beat." "8/2/2011"
"3.0" "My husband and I came here on a Friday afternoon. I had forgot that a lot of schools will take field trips on fridays so it was completely packed with kids. I did like seeing all the sea creatures but way too many kids running around and being unruly." "2/25/2012"
"4.0" "If it was based solely on the staff five stars however the price is high.  New display is very crystal clear but not all of the fish are in the tank yet.  Would have liked a construction-discount.  The dolphin show lasted 18 minutes and was great. They used to charge an extra cost for that. Plan two to three hours.  Keep your standards low for the food.  Clean facility and again very good staff and a lot of them ready to help.  TO: Adam outside and Adele at the customer service thank you!" "7/27/2013"
"3.0" "There's a special on Friday nights after 5pm that includes the dolphin show for less than the price of regular admission; although you can't enter after 8pm, you can stay until 9:30.  3 hours is plenty of time.  The dolphin show is great - not many aquariums have a full arena with a show like this.Most of the bottom floor is an open aquarium with walking paths over the water, where all kinds of rays and small sharks swim free - and  there's also a giant sea turtle - he doesn't come out often, but when he does, it's a treat!There are also plenty of unusual animals - an 8' octopus,several nautilus (nautili??), and I didn't know there were so many different kinds of jelly fish.Highly recommended!" "11/20/2011"
"4.0" "it was a nice weekend trip to head up to baltimore and visit a new city that is merely an hour drive away.  after enjoying a gluttonous brunch at miss shirley's and a dessert from vaccaro's, my friends and i decided to walk off our calories at the national aquarium.i wouldn't say that the aquarium was all that impressive, but it was still nice to walk through building and enjoy a short little break away from the rat race of dc.  it was a busy afternoon with tons of crowds that made the walk through a bit more of a semi-organized herd as opposed to a leisurely stroll.  but it is nice to see the kids there enjoying the wonders of the sea and ocean." "2/20/2012"
"1.0" "The National Aquarium in Baltimore is the largest and most impressive regional aquarium that I've been to in recent memory. The structure itself has a distinctive sharp shape.It's no Sea World, but there's still plenty of exhibits to entertain young folks, and even jaded older folks. Prices range from $20 to $30, depending on your age.If you or anyone you know is into aquatic animals - and not just eating them - stop in for a visit." "6/29/2009"
"4.0" "My family used to make the trip to the Baltimore Aquarium every summer and for the holidays. It was one of our favorite traditions. Nonetheless, our past two visits have been so positively miserable that we will not be returning in the foreseeable future. Here are some thoughts for those potential visitors:1.) the staff does nothing to control the crowds. Some exhibits are virtually impossible to enjoy as a result of visitors who are insistent upon taking a photo of every single fish/snake/lizard (I'm fairly certain these folks have never heard of the internet ... where each of these creatures can be located and photographs viewed). Sure, these people look like idiots (we have that small note of comfort ... especially when they use a flash), but they hold up the line INTERMINABLY. This occurred on both our last trips. Our group was so incensed that we vowed not to return. Certainly, the aquarium can prohibit photography or restrict it to specific areas; however, even in areas where flash-photography is strictly prohibited (since it can harm the wildlife), employees FAIL to enforce this policy. The learning experience here is lost ... co-opted by exhausting \"tourists\" who have virtually no self-control. 2.) the staff fails to instruct parents to watch their child/children and fails command respect for the wildlife contained within the walls. Our last two visits were a free-for-all of children screaming, pushing each other, and looking at everything but the exhibits. Filthy, tiny hand-prints covered the glass. We all Purelled after our visit like our life depended on it. School groups and larger groups should be provided with tour guides to both facilitate movement and quell the chaos. (And, rest assured visitors, IT IS CHAOS!)These are fairly easy fixes that management and lackadaisical employees fail to implement/enforce. It is such a pity to see this beautiful place of education become the chaotic, gross kindergarten experience that it is. We have begun a new tradition this holiday season ... one that certainly does not involve this aquarium." "12/28/2013"
"4.0" "i think this aquarium is more spacious and better than the boston new england aquarium. there are so many species and such to see that it can literally take a whole day. if you're in baltimore this tourist destination is a must see. the tickets are what you'd imagine an aquarium to cost. i wish they had corporate discounts to this location but i think they only give that to the local corporations that donate to them. definitely a must see!" "2/16/2012"
"4.0" "Went here on a recent visit to the Inner Harbor and was not disappointed. We did all three attractions (the aquarium, the dolphin show, and the 4D movie).The aquarium was fantastic (especially the Australian exhibit). The dolphin show was fun although corny. The girl who was the announcer was very scripted but the trainers were good. Probably could have skipped the 4D movie although the experience was pretty funny to see people screaming when air or water is blown on their face or the back of their seat pokes them. However, the movie was a Planet Earth segment and the 4D experience really took away from the amazing film in my opinion. I would have liked it better in a 2D format...but that's just me. I'm sure the kids in the audience loved the effects.Overall, worth the money to visit the aquarium if you are visiting the Inner Harbor." "11/14/2011"
"3.0" "I don't really know if I got to experience this aquarium to its full potential... I was here from DC on a field trip with my students. I will say they were very accommodating to our big group of about 100 kids. The dolphin show was pretty good, my students absolutely loved it. Everything was great, interactive shows and many things for the children.The aquarium itself seemed like a maze which was good and bad I guess." "3/19/2012"
"4.0" "I guess size doesn't matter.Granted that I have only been to two other aquariums in my lifetime; one being the National Aquarium in Washington DC (which is a glorified pet store), and the other being the North Carolina Aquarium at Roanoke Island, but when comparing the overall experience between these museums - Baltimore does not blow away the competition. Well, it does blow away the National Basement of the U.S. Commerce Building (aka the National Aquarium in Washington DC), but most pet stores blow that place away.First, let's compare prices:Baltimore - $25 for adult and $20 for a child (ages 3-11)[for the full experience - $30 for adult and $25 for a child]Roanoke Island - $8 for adults and $6 for a child (ages 3-12)Yes, the Baltimore Aquarium is certainly bigger than the Roanoke Island Aquarium, but in spite of the two buildings, multiple levels, and various exhibits, it took us only 2 hours to check out the entire Aquarium. In fact, you spend more time riding escalators and walking down ramps than you do actually observing sea life. True, the Baltimore Aquarium does have a few more things to see than most other East Coast Aquariums; the penguins and puffins, the Australian exhibit, and the Rainforest exhibit (where we did not see anything other than a couple of birds and mist being sprayed), but I have a hard time justifying three times the price of a 'smaller' aquarium. At least the Roanoke Island Aquarium had some interactive exhibits where you were allowed to touch sea life, such as sting rays and starfish. The only thing you are allowed to touch at the Baltimore Aquarium are the dolls at the (one of many) gift shops. I suppose I would recommend visiting on a Friday after 5pm (the aquarium closes at 8pm) where they have a reduced price, which of course, they don't really advertise, and you would get the true value of your dollar. One last note - the dolphin show isn't much of a show. It's about five minutes of having dolphins doing flips, waves, and splashing around for fish treats. If you really want to see a dolphin show - go on a dolphin tour the next time you go on a beach vacation, when they are feeding out in their natural habitat and not being forced to beg for treats like a circus poodle. The first part of learning about nature and our earth's wildlife - is to have respect for it." "5/15/2011"
"4.0" "Great place. We haven't been back since we were little kids so we decided to make a trip. Even as an adult, I remained in awe and rediscovered that sense of wonderment. Price wasn't bad and made for a great way to spend an afternoon." "1/19/2012"
"5.0" "4.25 stars.  I'm not the biggest fan of aquariums and zoos.  However, if I'm going to compare Baltimore's aquarium to those I have seen throughout the United States, there is simply no comparison.  Baltimore's National Aquarium is the best I have ever seen (out of roughly ten), and it's the only one where I feel I'm getting a somewhat different experience each time.  There are some people on here who complain that the rainforest exhibit is nothing more than mist sprays.  Perhaps that is frequently the case.  However, on this visit, one of the golden lion tamarins was offering us consistent entertainment whether he was jumping at breakneck speeds from limb to limb, chattering atop a perch at bewildered children, or reminding us of their striking ability to perform human-like actions (like voluntarily opening/closing and entering the door to his tiny home-cage without assistance).  Given that there are approximately two thousand of these animals left including those in zoos and shelters, one leaves with the understanding that they did indeed something unique.  Obviously, you won't get to see the golden lion tamarins on every visit, but that is what makes this space so unique.  Each time, if you are somewhat patient, you have the opportunity to see something spectacular.  There are all sorts of amazing wonders to find within this space.  I've seen a turtle in the stingray exhibit that is larger than I thought possible.  I've seen microscopic, bright hued poisonous frogs covering nearly the full spectrum of the rainbow.  If you like sharks, stingrays, jellyfish and any other dangerous creature from the sea, you will find them here.  If fish aren't your thing, perhaps you will be enchanted by the Icelandic puffins, the two-toed sloth, or a black python.  Quite simply, you are going to see some pretty spectacular creatures on every single visit.  The price here is an eye gouge (approximately $26 for each adult ticket and not much cheaper for kids), but the sights are worth seeing.  Highly recommended for those with at least a passing interest in nature." "6/25/2012"
"1.0" "Great for kids! I love this place, even though I'm heading towards my 30s : )  The coolest thing ever was the octopus they just got in.  I always spend at least three hours in there (and that's without any shows; that's literally just walking around the place).  Maybe I'm biased because I love fish, but I could stand and watch them for days (and yes, I have my own tank, but not with the extravagant fish they have here).The best part about this place?  The volunteers/workers who walk around talking about the fish.  You don't really understand how cool they are until you get the details from these guys, so if you see one standing next to a tank, make sure you ask questions!Get there early or get there late.  It gets awfully crowded, especially on the weekends and holidays!" "7/29/2011"
"4.0" "I never do this.  I feel it's unfair to leave a review for a place that you haven't actually been to, especially if it's a low rating.However, this really was my impression of the place so I felt compelled to leave this review.  In August 2011 I visited Baltimore with wife and offspring.  I was here for work and figured the wife and kid could go to the aquarium on one of the days I was working.However we looked it up and found that it would cost WAY TOO MUCH for just one adult and one child.   An adult is is $24 and a child (3-11 years old) is $20!!  Since there's no mass transit that stops at or near the aquarium, if you add up the train ride from our hotel plus a taxi, it would have cost nearly $70 for my wife and young child to go to the aquarium.  And we only have one kid!  With two kids it would have been  closer to $100.Forget it.I don't care how great the aquarium is, it's not worth this much to do one thing.  Kids will get bored in 2 hours no matter how good the place is, and will want to move on and do something else.You can have a lot more fun doing a lot more (different) things for a whole day in this area for $70... and they did.Sorry, National Aquarium - you need to lower your prices to make it accessible for the average family." "10/8/2011"
"4.0" "Do not skip the dolphin show. It's only $3 more, and you'll be regretful when you're just seeing them through the glass on the bottom level. This is going to sound really awful, but I would have had such a better time if there weren't so many children. I kept thinking to myself, \"Is there a night every few months when it's adults-only? Maybe just in the evening?\" It would be nice ... please don't send me hate mail. I like kids.The aquarium is an amazing place. I've never seen such huge stingrays or so many differenct species of fish in one place. You must go if you're in Baltimore. If you live in D.C./VA, you must drive there and see it." "9/6/2009"
"4.0" "Two adults + 5 kids = a pretty hefty entrance fee. Just be prepared. Overall, we all really enjoyed our visit and the kids were really into the dolphin show. The biggest drawback was accessibility for wheelchairs. We were given a map when we first arrived, but it was not very easy to understand, which meant we spent a lot of time just searching for accessible elevators. Some of the pathways were pretty narrow and a bit difficult to navigate, so keep that in mind if you are in a wheelchair. Skip the DC aquarium and go here! The jellyfish are worth the fee. If your heart is set on seeing the dolphin show, call ahead. They aren't always doing that. Think $5 to see the 15 minute 4D movie is too much? No, it's not. Don't skip it." "5/26/2011"
"4.0" "It's an outstanding aquarium. Even though the expensive tickets have your tour times printed on them, there can be a gazillion people in there. I'm sure some of the aquatic creatures and marine mammals are like, \"I've seen some large schools of fish before, but WTF are all these people doing in here? I feel sorry for you humans packed into this place like sweaty, smelly sardines.\" If you can, I suggest you go on Friday evenings when it's not so crowded and \"prices dive after five,\" to only $8." "9/21/2011"
"5.0" "I love aquariums.  I like the rotating exhibits (right now it's jellyfish, before that were frogs), dolphin show, and most of the other animals. You're going to be blinded by people's flashes because they're desperately want photos of light bouncing off of the glass tanks. Priceless, no? ;)Yep, it's expensive but it's not out of line with other aquariums.  Going after 5pm (or when school is in session) makes it less crowded and more enjoyable.Cons: Let's talk about the 4D theater.  Neat idea for grownups but I felt badly for the upset kiddos.  They tell you to remove your child before the show if they startle easily but really I can't see any kid under 8 (or *cough* 12) doing well in there.  The dozen or so children sitting around me, who varied from around 5 years old to 10 years old, either left shaking partway through or ended up sobbing on the nearest adult.  Poor kiddos." "7/3/2009"
"4.0" "Mmmmm nature!This place is really awesome and I highly recommend visiting. So much to see!The name might say aquarium but there is a lot more than just fish here. Lots of snakes and frogs, penguins, all sorts of stuff. One of my favorite things is the tropical rainforest they have at the top level. You go up there and you feel like you are in the rainforest (Complete with the humidity). All in all a great place to come and see sharks and stingrays and you name it." "2/6/2009"
"5.0" "Overall, the place is very nice. They have seriously everything! I loved the dolphin show...the trainers were really knowledgable and fun.If I were a teacher, I'd definitely take my class here on a field trip. Tip: it's probably best to go during the week or at a time where it wouldn't be crowded. The place is loaded with people on a Saturday afternoon to the point where you can't even walk up to half of the exhibits." "2/22/2011"
"4.0" "LIKE! Makes me feel like a kid....except I HATE kids and the ones that wander the halls of the aquarium. Disregarding that, I love this place." "1/28/2013"
"3.0" "It's kinda expensive.  It's always completely overrun by families with kids and large school groups (yes even in the summer, in which case it's summer camp groups).  The shows at Sea World may be bigger and more thrilling.  But I still get excited for the Baltimore's National Aquarium every time I go.Its distinctive shape punctuating the Baltimore harbor-line...the shark and ray tank on the lower level that you float over as you move from floor to floor...the high-flying dolphin show...wandering through the rainforest aviary...trying to identify whale tales by their scars and notches...the ever-changing exhibits on the myriad facets of marine and aquatic life.  Oh, and trying on shark masks in the gift shop so you can take pictures with your phone and send them to all your friends and loved ones.The National Aquarium never fails to entertain, enthrall, and educate about one of our most fragile ecosystems.  Well worth a visit on any trip to Baltimore." "11/23/2010"
"2.0" "Decent aquarium.  I was expecting to see more exhibits but what they provided was very clean and well presented.  Skip paying extra for the dolphin show and go down to the lower level where you can see them in the tanks underwater while the performance is going on.  It's awesome!  While waiting for their next trick they frolic with each other and that's the real entertainment. All in all, a nice, clean aquarium that I'm sure is much enjoyed by the little ones." "1/2/2012"
"4.0" "Review for Adults. Not for kids. I was so stoked as someone who has studied marine biology as was a career scuba diver to go to the aquarium when I had a friend visiting.So. Disappointing. For kids, fine. Kids like anything bright and shiny and moving. For anyone else? The rainforest is depressing, the Jellyfish exhibit is actually stupid and tiny, and the actual sea-life is totally limited." "11/9/2011"
"3.0" "I really love coming to the aquarium, but this last time I noticed that a few exhibits or tanks were empty. I'm wondering what happened to the petting tank and the rays? All in all though, still pretty relaxing/humbling experience!" "3/22/2013"
"5.0" "If you've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, you will leave disappointed and wanting more. Especially after the entrance fee.... (and AAA only gives a $2 discount!)It's not cheap, and the exhibits are not laid out well for strollers and tons of families to huddle in front of every glass habitat.The jellyfish exhibit was nice, but once again, if you've been to Monterey, they have an ongoing jelly fish exhibit that blows this one out of the water.Dolphin show addition was worth $3 more. There are two calves right now but you can't really sea them. They're in the back swim area. Also, the splash zone-- don't worry. I can't see the dolphins really splashing even the first row, unless on purpose.The rainforest and one other habitat are quite humid, so dress properly. It can also get warm with all the bodies if you go on a weekend.Also, just be aware of the timed entrance. You may need to grab lunch after getting your tickets. Or else you could hang around for an hour.On Sundays (not sure of other days) parking down Lombard and South/Commerce is 10$ full day." "6/19/2011"
"3.0" "Went to Baltimore with a couple of friends and the day before we went home we stopped my the aquarium, best decision we made for the whole trip. This aquarium is simply breath taking. The atmosphere is great, never once do u feel rushed or told to go somewhere u aren't willing. The workers are great help too, answering any questions u have with a smile on there face. Yes, their are a lot of kids there, but i went to the aquarium with friends near the age of 30 and never once were we bothered by a cry baby or have kids stepping on our feet. great place to bring a girl or just to hang with some friends. In overall, i couldn't give the National Aquarium a better review. If ur ever in Baltimore make sure to find ur way to the aquarium, the prices r very affordable!" "8/20/2011"
"5.0" "I have to say I wasn't very impressed. It is huge and pretty good lay out but I've seen better. It's a shame since given the size they could have kept a much more diverse fish population. At the very least I can say 'been there done that'." "8/27/2011"
"2.0" "Fantastic aquarium! One of the best I've gone to in the States. I like how the interior has a path that was set up for its visitors. It guarantees that you'll see everything they have to offer. They not only have just sea creatures but sloths and birds as well. My favorite is definitely the jelly fish section. It's more worth going to on a Friday after 5 cause it's 8 bucks! Three times cheaper than the regular price. I went in at 5:30 and I saw everything by 7:15. 2 hours is more than enough time to see everything. I really can't get over how they have the exhibits set up. It runs on a path so no matter where you start you'll always be on it and you won't have to worry if you missed an exhibit or not. I've always hated walking around museums or educational centers feeling lost and wondering if I saw all they had to offer." "10/7/2011"
"4.0" "Aquarium is very cool. They changed the dolphin show, it's a come and go show, a trainer talking, kinda boring, bring back the old show!" "8/19/2013"
"5.0" "There are four magnificent areas:Sharks and Other  - this is the largest main part and the highlight for us was the GIGANTIC Octopus. It is massive and beautiful. I have never seen anything like it, and I've been to my fair share of Aquariums and have been scuba diving multiple times. Dolphins and Jellies - it really is just those two things. The dolphins are so neat to watch and so are the Jellies. They're sort of in separate areas and are kept apart from the rest of the museum.Rainforest - There are birds flying around and other neat things to notice, but the best thing is the Sloth. Hopefully he's a bit active while you're there, because he is really cool.Australia - This reminded me of the Rainforest part in look and feel. It's smaller though, but still nice. Yes, an adult ticket is $24, which is a bit steep for a 2 hour activity, but it was gobs of fun! We made some great memories there!Other highlights: Gigantic sea turtle, uber small poisonous frogs, a couple Tarantulas, and electric eel." "11/7/2011"
NA "I'm in love with this place.  It's possibly the best $25 I've spent (for the worst, please see the Newseum).It's educational, engaging, entertaining, fun, relaxing, interesting and one helluva workout.  I remember walking in at maybe 10am and walking out at almost 2pm.  I tried to take in everything and had to stop.  The building does appear large on the outside, but so much larger inside.  You go up, around and down and it's so much fun.I also like that there a few places to eat, because it can get crowded and you will need a place to sit and get a bite.  My favorite is the little side spot in the middle of the building.  It's my favorite not because of the food (which is just okay), but for the view of the harbor which is really nice and relaxing.I also like the shark tank and the feeding show, but there is one thing that is the star of show and a big finish, literally.  The end with what I call the \"Hall of Tanks\".  It's the rear of the tanks, on a wonderfully curved walkway, lit only by the light of the tanks.  You see the fish swimming by with not a care in the world and the care takers feeding them.  It's nice and dim and silent and ends with a bench that you can sit on before exiting the building.  I think I spent an hour on that bench, I really didn't want to leave.Experience it, it's really worth the money.  BTW, fellas, it would make a really wonderful date that may almost certainly include a night of...luckiness. #imjustsayin" "2/7/2011"
