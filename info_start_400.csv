"4.0" "They have a pretty cool shark exhibit and I liked that we were able to leave the Aquarium (to eat lunch) and re-enter thereafter. The aquarium is also a lot bigger than we anticipated - it'll take a few hours to get through... AND the dolphin show is free! It's worth a visit (and one of the main reasons to visit Baltimore)." "1/29/2010"
"5.0" "Phenominal aquarium. The only reason it is a 4 star is the fact that i bought my tickets at 1:30 and couldn't get into the aquarium until 4:30. Otherwise it was laid out extremly well and had a lot of beautiful exhibits. I have been to aquariums in Monterey, Long Beach, and Chicago and this was better than all of them. A lil pricey, but worth it." "7/18/2012"
"5.0" "Chaperoned a 4th grade class field trip.  The staff was amazing!  Our first stop was a 45 minute class, in a classroom.  The instructor was funny, the kids were engaged and not bored for one second.  They also got to go from station to station, allowed to \"one finger touch\" the live  animals.  How cool is it that they got to touch a sea urchin, horseshoe crab, welk?After our class session, we were free to explore the aquarium from the bottom (sharks) to the top (rainforest).  Monkeys, tarantulas, a sloth, birds, sharks, eels, poison dart frogs, incredibly funny and friendly dolphins, the jelly fish invasion... the list goes on.   It was a wonderful day, in a beautiful building filled with friendly staff and amazing animals." "2/25/2011"
"2.0" "I had no plans to go here at all.   However, a bunch of folks from our convention said they were going here after class so I decided to join in.What a good time.  It was quite interesting.  We only had about an hour to check it out which really is not enough time, however, we just kept up a good pace and checked out most things.The design of the aquarium was really beautiful.  It appears that they take wonderful care of the exhibits and animals.I really enjoyed myself.  I would recommend this to all tourists in the Baltimore area." "3/1/2008"
"4.0" "Guess I'm in the minority here, not rating the aquarium four or five stars, but I really didn't think it was worth the cost. I did really enjoy the dolphin show-get there 30 minutes before the show to get good seats. The set up is terrible-who designed this?? The lay out is a maze and does not help the crowd problem. I find it disappointing this is Maryland's big attraction." "5/10/2010"
"4.0" "Not bad aquarium for their size.Check on Friday after 5pm $5!" "2/1/2011"
"5.0" "This was a great place to visit on our day trip to Baltimore from the DC area. The aquarium is located in the Inner Harbor, which seems like a pretty popular place four tourists and appears to be much more tourist-friendly and safer than other parts of the city.Admission was a bit on the pricey side, but the place had a really neat layout and some fish I'm pretty sure I haven't seen before despite frequent trips to other aquariums. This place wasn't as good as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but it was better than the Birch Aquarium in San Diego that I grew up with. I didn't buy anything at the gift shop here, but it was pretty big and had plenty of stuff that was cool but a waste of money.Good place to take your family, but I feel like anyone could have a good time here." "11/9/2010"
"3.0" "4.5 stars... The National Aquarium in Baltimore (opened in 1981) is the largest tourist attraction in Maryland attracting about 1.6 million people annually. They've got about 16,500 animals (650 different species). The aquarium is located in the very beautiful, clean, and touristy Inner Harbor area of Baltimore. Admission is about $25 for just the aquarium and about $28 if you'd like to also go to the Dolphin show (well worth the extra $3). The main attractions of the aquarium are the stingrays, sharks, dolphins (you can only see them if you go to the dolphin show), and rain forest exhibit (complete with crocodiles). They also have an amazing jellyfish exhibit which might not be a permanent exhibit so if you haven't been I'd check it out. The aquarium may look a bit modest in size from the outside but it's actually pretty huge, beautiful, and clean (Coastal Living Magazine named it the #1 aquarium in the U.S. in 2006). It can get a bit busy but they limit the amount of people they let in each hour so it doesn't get out of hand which is a fantastic idea, especially in the summer. I had a great time at the aquarium. I haven't been to many aquariums so me saying it's the best one I've been to doesn't mean too much but I definitely think its worth the steep admission price." "4/8/2010"
"2.0" "A bit pricy ($30/person w/o the Dolphin show or the \"4-D\" movie, both of which are extra), but a fun experience. It's nice to support this type of initiative and the exhibits are very well thought out.We spent about 90 minutes and I would expect it to be difficult for an adult to spend much more than that here. As far as being a centerpiece in the Inner Harbor district, we enjoyed it!" "4/7/2011"
"5.0" "I don't get the rave reviews here..... We spent the weekend in Baltimore with our two kids (10/6) and hit this place when it opened at 10AM on a Monday.The \"Meh's\":1. The displays are nothing more than any other \"ok\" aquarium.  Big tanks with rays/sharks-Yep, that's what you pay to see.2. The route through it was so disorganized (no flow) they actually had staff in a number of places to tell you to turn around.  I know there was some construction going on but it appeared this wasn't the reason for the staff being in certain places.3. Expensive food and gift shop.  I don't mind buying a $15 octopus, but at least make it big enough to cover my hand.4. The younger staff in the shops and support folks (cleaning/maint) were about as friendly as a guppy.  Not even a smile when I said hello.5. Dolphin show.  I didn't expect Shamu's Seaworld fireworks, but \"lame\" is the best word I can think of to describe it.     a. The announcer said her lines like a robot and seemed to have little interest in the crowd.    b. The dolphins did a total of six jumps, which, lets be honest, is what we all paid to see.  It makes the kids scream and grown-ups clap.  They had the little globes over the pool but only used them once and that was the only time a dolphin actually jumped \"high\".    c.  Three times, we were directed to watch the Dolphin swim around the tank to show off it's power.The \"Good's\"1. The older staff was VERY nice and helpful.  An older gent gave us some tips on how best to see things.2. The place was clean.Bottom Line:If you are in Baltimore and need a place to go with the kids, by all means go here.  But, if you live north of Baltimore, go to Camden.  If you live in DC, sadly, this is way better than the National Aquarium Downtown." "1/25/2012"
"5.0" "Absolute Awesome time. Everything was a little pricey but it's what is expected at a tourist place like this. Dolphin presentation was fun and the whole family had a great time. We started at about 9am and saw everything plus two Dolphin presentations in about 5 hours and we were not bored 1 time. Staff was super friendly and very informative. Kind of like they really enjoyed to be there. It made the trip worth it." "7/22/2012"
"4.0" "We were in Baltimore for a short time and the National Aquarium was high on our priority list. Tip for the day, get your tickets in advance, so you can skip the long lines. Our first stop was at the stingray pool. They are so relaxing and calming to watch, you can stand there for hours watching them soar by. Plus, the pool contained some sharks and huge turtles. Cool. Next we visited The 4-D Immersion Theater. This was nothing I like could have expected. They 3-D movie was great, but you also got some extra \"surprises\". I was really getting tired of \"spit\" in my face, if you get what I mean. Next was the dolphin show. It was fun, but nothing too exciting. Then we were off to see the Jellyfish. I loved this exhibit. I didn't know there were so many different types! After that we saw the Australia and the rain forest. And then just wondered thru and checked out all the other smaller fish displays. All in all, it took us about 4 1/2 hours to see everything. It's a great aquarium!" "7/20/2009"
"3.0" "This is a really pretty aquarium. I am still fascinated by the water tubes...kind of reminds me when toilet flushes and that's how the water are in pipes. It's really awesome watching the jelly fish. I think I can just stand in front of their tank the whole day and watch how they move so gracefully. I also got to see employees scuba diving in the tanks and feeding the sharks, which was pretty neat. I really wanted to see penguins, but it seems like they didn't have any. However they did have puffins, which are cute too. From the outside of the aquarium I saw the HUGE rainforest inside a glass case, but when I went in the rainforest area it wasn't really that big. I guess going in the morning would be better and you get more time to look at things without crowds of people hovering over the tanks." "10/30/2009"
"5.0" "This place use to be my all time favorite place to go. Then like all great things, some stupid people have to change everything up. The Australian exhibit that they put in was such a waste. The thing takes up a quarter of the building and you can only walk through a tiny percentage of that! The rainforest is still the best. I miss the sea lions they have outside. The price is ridiculous. Almost 30 dollars a ticket and that's not including the dolphin show!! Not to mention it's always crowded so no way to really enjoy the exhibits. I try to go to the very last time which is much better but I feel recently other people have been finding that out as well.I would recommend waiting until they do the Friday night $5 specials (once a year for a month) but be prepared for a crowd." "12/2/2010"
"4.0" "Awesome experience and there's so much to do, so much to learn. There's a 4d show, amazon experience, and tons of other cool stuff! Went on a Sunday and it wasn't packed at all was able to see everything without a wait." "5/9/2012"
"4.0" "We have visited here at least twice and the exhibits are just fantastic.  One issue that have to address is the crowd.  Be prepared to enter at least 30 to 90 minutes from when you purchased your ticket at the booth.  The ticket agent didn't even tell us so it was annoying.  If you go first thing in the morning, then you will get in with no delay.  The major exhibit which is first bldg with rainforest is probably the best.  Afterwards, the special exhibit is a bit lacking in magnitude and ummphh.  Just a bunch of jellies which I have seen better done at the Mystic Aquarium which is smaller than Baltimore.  The other exhibit which is minor in comparison to the first bldg is the Australian bldg.  Nothing too special here since it almost looks like the rainforest with some desert exhibits that differentiate it.  I think they need to rethink the Australian exhibit to something totally different like the Arctic with penguins, whales, seals, etc.  With the ticket price at $25, don't expect a new exhibit to keep cost the same-- only goes up.  Then again, it looks like people still flock with exhibits still the same since 10-15 years ago." "1/4/2012"
"5.0" "Two flippers up. Not as great as Monterey or the Shedd, but I was definitely impressed with Baltimore's aquarium. I went early, 10am on a Friday and it was not crowded at all (yay--no annoying school kids!!). And it was feeding time for the rays and giant sea turtle that was missing a front flipper. Watching it gnaw on lettuce was very soothing for some reason. I wish I had it so simple and easy! The layout is very easy to navigate. It's just like IKEA. I dont know why other people dont like the layout. And if you are complaining about walking for one hour, you probably shouldnt be here in the first place. Unlike some other aquariums I've been to, the animals were very visible in the exhibits. The staff and volunteers were friendly but not intrusive. They really made an effort to point out what was inside each exhibit. I really liked the rainforest installation.  There are HUGE fruit bats hanging from the ceiling, lots of different colorful birds, turtles and other criters to enjoy looking at.  The giant main fish tank is several floors high and well stocked with colorful fish.  I made it for feeding time, here, as well.  I think I spent 2 hours here, and I didnt even go to any of the shows. I was quite happy and relaxed by the end of my visit.  I would go back." "9/18/2010"
"3.0" "Been coming here for years, and I have never, EVER been disappointed. It was time for me to bring my own family here to carry on the tradition of visiting the aquarium. It's a very fun and educational aquarium and very clean too. The dolphin show is both hilarious and entertaining. My kids had a really good time and can't wait to return." "6/12/2012"
"5.0" "Two let-downs of this aquarium: 1. The dolphin show is not worth the extra bucks. Too much talking and video clips and not enough tricks from dolphins. There was a wading pool [or some kind of resting pool] behind the main pool with other dolphins. I kept waiting for those dolphins to jump into the main pool and do some kind of tricks but nothing....2. The main sea life exhibit in the center with the sharks wasn't too exciting either. They kept all the different types of fish separated so there was no interaction as you might see out in the open ocean. Boston's is better--they have the sharks, turtles, and other fishing co-habiting in their main tank.Other than that, the rest wasn't too bad. There's a huge turtle [not sure what kind] swimming with the sting rays that's missing one of it's front flippers and it's sad to watch because it takes him a little longer to get to his food especially if he miscalculates his strokes." "8/11/2007"
"4.0" "Huge Aquarium, the price was reasonable, we did the 4-D and Dolphin Show as it was not much more than admission.  All three came to $30 each, which really is not expensive considering what you get.Everything was interesting and the little room where you can look into the Inner Harbor was cool as well.  The shark tank was interesting and the dolphin show was interesting.  Definitely worth the trip, but plan to be there for a good part of your day as there is a lot to see." "10/21/2009"
"2.0" "Well worth the money.  Easily one of the best aquariums I've been to.  Enormous layout, we weren't able to traverse everything in the 3 hours we were there!  The dolphin show was very enjoyable, but far shorter than I had hoped unfortunately.Definitely get there early--we went on a Tuesday morning and it was jam packed by lunch time!" "8/10/2010"
"3.0" "I visited this past Saturday. Got in early, around noon, to beat the crowd. Is it just me or did you also notice that there's less sea life in the water. Hmm.... The only enjoyment was seeing the Hawks-billed Sea turtle (who's missing a front flapper) come up for air. Okay, maybe also seeing the Long-horned Cow-fish.I think the kids will still enjoy it but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.  Not a kid anymore...." "3/21/2011"
"3.0" "This aquarium is just OK for me.  Being from Denver which has a much bigger aquarium I was disappointed in the displays and the price.  $30 a person for what?  The only thing that made that $30 worth it was the dolphin show.  Otherwise the aquariums were too small and hard to see.  They try to make up for this with a big pool in the middle of the building which you can look down on but who cares when you get to the top floor and have seen it 5 times already looking down.  There is a big stair case that goes through a huge tank that was pretty cool.  Otherwise-boring and pricey!!" "4/18/2012"
"3.0" "Being the aquarium aficionado that I am, the National Aquarium in Baltimore gets an a-okay from me! An on-site parking would have been nice, but a stroll along the docks (after having parked in the pier v garage) proved to be nicer.Greeted by a pool of stingrays followed by all types of sea life thinkable, each exhibit seems to be more fascinating than the last. Head on over to the Australian exhibit and land creatures await you. Creatures that impressed me the most included the coral reefs, poisonous frogs, and the stingrays.Don't just stop at the ooh and ahhs over the animals though. Seriously consider the dolphin show and 4-D theater package -- and you'll be glad you did! The dolphin show was nowhere as impressive as Sea World's rendition, but it was much enjoyable. The diminutive theater fills up rather quickly, so get your tickets online or at the entrance if possible (rather than purchasing the bundle after having gone through the entire aquarium.) The showing is not recommended for the ticklish folks however :)" "3/20/2009"
"4.0" "Coming to the National Aquarium on Memorial Day weekend is probably not the best idea ever....but we had fun considering the crazy crowds and heat.Super easy to get tickets--just pay online and head to the kiosk near the will call booth, swipe your credit card used to pay for the tickets, and VOILA! I liked the staggered times to get in as well.The layout is kind of meh, though the spiral exhibit is a cool idea. There are too many areas where people are waiting to move on to the next area (the turnabouts). It seems like there is stuff missing, like the variety of creatures seemed lacking and the inclusion of all the land animals was strange....but I dunno....I'm not an attraction planner.The jellyfish exhibit was really neat--definitely the highlight. It had a clear focus and tons of neat info.The cost is on par with other large aquariums; we got our money's worth. Go when the weather is tolerable and there are less people and you'll have a good time." "5/30/2010"
"1.0" "I've visited this aquarium twice & had a good time - I certainly suggest getting a ticket if you're heading to Baltimore.Is it the biggest, best aquarium out there?  Frankly, I dunno.  I know it's five floors and that it houses many varieties of marine life as well as rotating exhibits, a 4-D movie, & a dolphin show.Is it crowded during peak times, & might you encounter rudeness?  Of course it is & of course you may - it's a tourist attraction.  My feeling is, you'll encounter rudeness at any tourist attraction provided it houses more than ten at a time.  I happen to think it's worth it in this case.  To cut down on the bane of every tourist - waiting on line/in line - buy tickets ahead of time.  You can do this online or at the Aquarium itself - just mosey on over the day before you want to go, get on line (Hey! I said \"cut down on\", not \"eliminate\"!), buy a timed ticket.  When you come back the next day, you just mosey on in.The other nice thing is that you can leave & come back during the same day - just get a hand stamp.  I have no idea what the cafeteria food is like, but I bet it'd be nicer to leave, have lunch in the Inner Harbor, & come back.  Also, parents of young kids may want to split up the day with a nap (for everyone) - the re-entry policy makes it possible.Do go - it's fun at least once!" "7/30/2009"
"4.0" "Run away.  Run far, far away.  If when going to the aquarium you like not seeing much sea life, unless you count the 1,000 pound beached whale families loping their sweaty way around the cramped and smelly pavilion, then this place is for you.  Be prepared to encounter not so much fish as screaming kids, strobe-light flash photography and general touristy madness.  I've been to nice aquariums in California (Long Beach and Monterey), and this is nothing like those.  The only redeeming features were a few sharks and some jellyfish, which weren't all that spectacular.  Again, you could see these only if you were prepared to wade through the mobs crowded around each exhibit.  I've never seen so many people interested in goldfish.  I've also never seen so many fat people in one place before.  It was generally disgusting.  After about fifteen minutes, we hurried through to get some pics of the jellies and then we were out of there.If I may backtrack a bit, the first thing we had to do was wait in line to get tickets to wait in line again.  Once the second line was done, you got to wait in line again while morons got their photos taken against cheesy backdrops that looked like screen savers from 1993.  Bear in mind it was 93 and humid outside.  I thought there would be some relief once inside, but the boggy fumes emanating from obese tourists from Alabama and South Carolina were enough to replicate the beautiful MD weather.  A lovely experience, to be sure.  If you're somewhat of a masochist.  Blech." "7/3/2009"
"4.0" "This place has gotten a lot cooler with their new jelly fish exhibit, they are mystifyingIts been ages since Ive paid full price, I go for \"Fridays after 5\" prices got bumped up to $8, its NOT through out the year though, so check ahead. Drawback it can be a little crowded, and I suggest buying a ticket ahead, especially if you want to see the dolphin show on this day, cuz I believe they sell out, actually I probably havent been to a show since I was a kid.The BEST time had to have been 4yrs ago when they had seahorses, I waited in the rain, for what seemed forever, to see them, and I was like \"this better be worth it\", and it really was, just in awe, great memory!" "7/13/2010"
"2.0" "Go on Fridays during the discount time for the \"Fridays after 5 take a dive\" . . . only $8 per person and you have enough time to see everything with less people around.  Now, you can't see the movies (go to the science center then) or the dolphin show (go to some other water park), but the highlight of the aquarium is the other stuff to me, anyway.  Although, I will admit that seeing the rainforest at night is hard for picking out animals.The new Australian exhibit is not impressive at all.  It's the main reason I wanted to go again (I hadn't been since they put it in), but it was tiny and not as cool looking as it is on the outside.This is a great place to go as a couple or with a family.  You can learn lots of things and see cool fishies! :D" "4/10/2009"
"4.0" "I have an annual membership since it doesn't make sense to pay so much for 2 adults and a child for one visit.  The membership pays for itself plus the kid loves the stingrays and fish.  We went a week ago during one of the Hallowmarine days.  Total rip off. They promised trick or treating for the kids, and not once did we see any of the workers giving out candy.  We went from top to bottom and to both wings, and nada.  We were to embarrassed to ask any of the workers where the candy stations were. A lot of kids even dressed up in costumes with their pumpkins.   Nat. Aqua, don't ever advertise giving out candy if you are going to be so cheap about it. They gave people maps for a supposed scavenger hunt and places where the candy stations were, which were about 3 measly place but we weren't about to go out of our way to hunt down these 3 places with a 3 year old who wanted to look at the fish.  I felt sorry for the kids who were actually dressed up in costumes. My son didn't want to wear his so we were uselessly carrying around a candy pail, which my husband stuffed his hat into.  I would peer into other parents pails and pumpkins and see them stuff it with articles of clothing also!  No candy in sight.  They should never advertise any type of treat giving. They should have at least had someone giving out candy near Dora.  However, for an adult, I wouldn't bother wasting my money on this place. The dolphin show will put you to sleep. They don't do that many spectacular tricks.  It's better to watch them swim in their tank below water level than the actual show.  We skipped the show and went to visit Dora near the under water level tank views, and it was amazing to see them swim during the shows.  One of the dolphins actually went up to a lone woman and and started interacting with her through the glass.  We were all rather shocked, esp. the woman who could not stop laughing.  Only 4 of us were down there. Without crowds, an adult could see the aquarium in an hour.  Really not worth the $30 something dollar charge. Our kid spends a good 3 hours in here so we tolerate it, but it's not really a magical place except for the huge shark tank, which can be breathtaking and cool." "11/1/2011"
"4.0" "\"Is anyone here a marine biologist?\"--Seinfeld, Episode #78, first aired 2-10-1994I am not a marine biologist, but I do like to gawk at the fishies every once in a while.  More specifically, I am a big fan of the shiny, fluorescent tropical fishies.  What can I say, I am a visual person who likes bright colors.  Sharks are pretty amazing, too.  I've been to this aquarium three times, and I always managed to have a good time.  If you find yourself in Baltimore, the National Aquarium is a definite must see.  For my money, it's one of the best aquariums in the country, second only to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California.  Speaking of money, a visit to the National Aquarium in Baltimore is not cheap.  Basic admission will cost you $21.95 ($12.95 for your kid under 11).  Prices go up to $25.95 and 14.95, respectively, if you're interested in seeing the dolphin show.  Warning: first three rows may get wet!We came in last Sunday around 12 noon, and the place was PACKED.  I don't remember any aquarium being that crowded before.  I never thought I'd suggest it, but they should really consider limiting admission.  Why not sell tickets for 12:15 and let the 12:00 group enjoy the exhibits in peace?  The crowds were pretty bad.  We had to give up on seeing some of the exhibits  because of the sheer number of people trying to fight their way to the glass walls.  I swear, it would have been easier to find seats on the glass at the Rangers game at Madison Square Garden!  To move from one exhibit to another, I had to be the lead blocker for my friend, creating holes for her to run through.  All the while, I wanted to make sure I didn't trample over some poor kid trying to see the starfish or the catfish.  Advice: go during off-peak hours to avoid crowds.The only place that was not crowded was the cafe.  The menu included overpriced hamburgers, overpriced chips and . . . overpriced fish sandwiches.  Fish sandwiches at the aquarium?  Talk about irony!  I guess it's never too early to teach your kids that Flounder from Disney's Little Mermaid is nothing but a fish stick waiting to happen . . .sigh.    Why not just cut out the middleman and put price tags on the fish tanks: \"Spotted Puffer, $6.99/lb\"???" "1/3/2009"
"4.0" "We arrived here first thing on a Saturday morning in the hopes of beating some of the crowds. I think that worked fairly well for us, since only the first two floors of the main tank area were crowded and everywhere else was fine. Try to view the dolphin and jellyfish exhibits while the dolphin show is happening. You still get to see the dolphins doing jumps and playing in the viewing area down below. Both exhibits were empty while the show was going on, but right after it ended they got packed. Also, if you want to see the ray feeding, go up one level, you can see better than on the main floor and it's less crowded. There were also several divers doing a feeding in the big circular reef tanks while we were there and no crowds. I second Jen R.'s sentiments about the 4-D show. Not appropriate for young kids. Lots of folks had to leave when their young children started crying and they don't offer readmissions or refunds. The young boy next to me started screaming when he got sprayed with water, so his family had to leave." "6/1/2009"
"3.0" "While there are a few cons (expensive, long lines, and massive crowds) plus a few negatives for me in particular (I have a 2 second attention span, the rainforest = major humidity/me coming out with an afro, and I'm terrified by thoughts of falling into the stingray pool) this is definitely somewhere you need to go at least once if you live in the area, or if you're visiting.   The dolpin show is incredibly cute, the views of the Inner Harbor from inside the aquarium are wonderful, and overall it's just a good place to spend a few hours." "4/5/2009"
"4.0" "If you've been to the Monterey or Atlanta or Chicago aquariums, this will leave you underwhelmed. If you haven't, it's probably one if the best around.Like all aquariums, there are loads of kiddos zipping around and shoving to get to the glass here, so be prepared if you don't have a child in tow. They don't allow strollers into the exhibits for some reasons, so by the end, there are lots of cranky kids and parents worn out from packing little ones.Entry and dolphin shows are often timed, so buy tickets online for easiest access lest you have to wait 2 hours (an eternity with a 3 year old) for a dolphin show. Parking is non-existent, so grab a space a few blocks away and walk around the inner harbor area where the dinner cruises depart. You'll get some nice views of classic ships. There are lots of unprotected long views down to the open stingray pool and the exhibits go quite high up, so if you've got issues with heights, this isn't a great option. The Australia exhibit offered some up-close views of critters but wasn't very comprehensive. Expensive, but they all are. Some local agencies offer discount tickets, so if you have local friends, be sure to ask around. It's quite dark in many of the exhibits - more so than other aquariums tend to be. Divers are often in the tanks feeding and are friendly to kids." "5/11/2009"
"4.0" "I recently came here as I do about twice a year. The last 3 times I have come with a new person or friend was a little disappointing and made me look like a fool for spending around $40 for two tickets. I love the animals but why don't they warn you before you pay if the exhibit is going to be down?No bats on the ceiling in the Australian exhibit, No monkeys in the forest, no exhibit with the birds.Disappointing and I am just happy to help with the food contribution. I love this place but I'm tired of being let down or left out. I will give four stars for all the times I went and loved it. Come on Baltimore! Let's get it together! My favorite parts are the sharks, turtle with one limb missing, the northern diving birds, and monkeys. The dolphins are great to see down below if you have viewed too many dolphin shows in your life. =)" "3/24/2010"
"4.0" "I have been to this aquarium 4x, most recently yesterday. There's alot of wonderful aspects of this place and in a nutshell it's a must-see for adults and kids alike. There's something magical about seeing people stare at something they've only read about or seen on a screen. Jellyfish? Check! Sharks and manta rays? They've got 'em! Dolphin show? Worth the extra few dollars.! That said, it's not something most people can afford very often. We make special trips there, like treating our son to his birthday or meeting friends from out of town. Yesterday was the first time we went on a weekend and whoa nelly, it was dreadful. It was so crowded that there was about a 10 min wait just to get to see a display and it was hot and muggy in the hallways from the amount of people crammed into a room. The escalators were out of order in one area, so there were detours, which was fairly displeasing (not because we had to use stairs, but because they had to reroute people and it was disorderly.) Our mistake was trying to find a place to eat after exiting the aquarium, on a Saturday afternoon. Average wait time was 45 minutes (this was at 3pm). With little kids in tow, that was not fun. Be prepared to be patient, no matter where you are.As I have done in the past, I would suggest to others to go on a weekday and get there when they open. It makes all the difference in your experience to be the only one at a display and not be rushed. Bring snacks, take breaks and enjoy!" "2/19/2012"
"5.0" "This is a big & impressive aquarium. The staff seems pretty informed of what they talk about during the tours & are happy to answer questions. Their shark display is no joke either, that alone will keep you busy for a while. Plenty of entertainment, gift shops & species to explore. It's very kid friendly and many times they have workshops at designated times.Tickets are kinda pricey but if this is your cup of tea it's not a bad deal." "12/6/2011"
"5.0" "wow.ok so I haven't been here in a looooooong time.But, I spent the day here with some old friends in, like, the spring of 1992 (that's not a typo) and spring of 1998 (no typo again).I remember both days being quite enjoyable.It's kinda cool how you can see a shark appear like it's stalking you...if you stand at the glass and stare long enough that is...kinda creepy, but in a really cool \"glad i'm not in the water\" kinda way.Considering I haven't been to this place in over a decade, can't really say too much about it.5 stars for me!"

"5.0" "I take the 2hr drive from Philadelphia at least once a year to check this place out. It is constantly changing. I would stay away from the 4D Planet Earth movie if you are going with kids. It may be too scary considering you get poked in the back and get hit on the legs with a wire and also get wet. Its supposed to feel like the animals are coming out of the movie which adults will understand but not so much the children. The Shark tanks is crazy! They swim around you in their tank and you feel very close to them. I dont want to spoil too much. Each exhibit tries to make you feel like you are really in their world. This is a MUST see. I suggest taking a day off or even a half day of work to go here. It gets really packed during the weekend. A certain number of people are allowed in at any given time so you are given a time of entry. If they are too full you may be left waiting hours or might end up going back home without getting in. If you are left inside close to their closing time you may miss an exhibit. They close the exhibits off as soon as they are empty even though you didnt get there yet. (This happend to me last time). Its nice to take your time so go early." "10/7/2008"
NA "The view! The exhibits! THE SEALS!What an amazing aquarium. I was last here right after they opened the Australia exhibit, and just sat and watched the waterfalls for a while. There's so much to see and even more to learn. And the staff (which I seem to recall being primarily volunteers, or at least the ones I chatted with were) is so helpful and knowledgeable and can answer almost any question. When you're done admiring the animals (the seals really are the most adorable things ever), you can take a walk around the harbour, which offers a beautiful view. And, honestly. How can you NOT love a place where adults can shout out \"I FOUND NEMO!!\" just as enthusiastically as small children as they pass the clown fish exhibit?" "9/17/2008"
