"1" "4.0" "Best aquarium ive ever been to. Its a bit pricey at nearly $22...$25 if you buy the joint dolphin show ticket (definitely worth it). Tons of different types of marine life. They have A LOT of turtles and since those are my favorite I love this place even more. For some reason a lot of aqauriums have like one or 2 different types of turtles and thats it. I think it has a lot to do with the local college though. Big turtle city. Anyway...this is pretty much the only reason to come to baltimore. Now that ive come here theres no reason for me to ever come back!" "2/14/2007"
"2" "1.0" "I came here for a wedding and had an incredible time! The aquarium was beautiful and interesting and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. It was so much fun!" "5/27/2011"
"3" "5.0" "Too crowded. Great place to throw away fifty bucks for nothing." "11/15/2011"
"4" "4.0" "This is one of the best Aquariums i've ever visited. The dolphin show at the end is absolutely amazing. It's best to go there early in the day, mid-week, to beat the crowds :-)" "3/23/2011"
"5" "4.0" "This is the best animal-related venue I've ever visited.  It's very, very nice.It is starting to show its age, but overall, an amazing experience.  Pros:  the ray exhibit (note- don't waste too much time from above, you'll have underground views later that are 10X better), the jellies are terrific, the gift shop is reasonable.Cons:  the ticket purchase experience is lame, the staff are a mix of good/bad, the dolphin show is decent but I seem to recall it being more exciting years ago, the escalator to the rainforest was broken." "9/9/2009"
"6" "5.0" "I enjoyed this aquarium....its not that expensive to get in, and it really is worth the money you have to pay. I went on some down time during a convention, and aside from the crowds from a school trip it was really nice. The layout is nice, as each exhibit flows nicely into the next, and the exhibits are really full of information if you want to learn about things. Even if you just go to go, it's a really relaxing trip.One cool feature is the shark area, which I think is a 5 level area where you walk down and see all types of sharks. And the bird area is pretty cool, you see them up close and personal.The only thing I didn't get to see was the dolphin area, as the dolphin was pregnant and due to give birth. I highly recommend this to anyone, its a pretty fun time, and they have old ships outside that you can check out too." "10/7/2009"
"7" "4.0" "HUGE Sharks swimming 360 degree aquariums.  Rainforest exhibit with exotic birds flying overhead.Giant stingrays.  I mean....GIANT.I have a new pet fish there named TJ." "5/21/2009"
"8" "4.0" "First, I appreciate this as a world class aquarium and the staff are very helpful and eager to help you learn and point out hidden animals and fish.The exhibits are all well done, and the fish are all displayed very well. When we got there, we traded our daughter's stroller for a \"snuggli\" which was free of charge. That was a very nice (free) benefit. The walk was easy, and the only nit I have was that some of the moving pathways were a little narrow - and I was there when there were a lot of young school students. (Geez, do they even teach manners anymore?)Do not come here if you want a cheap date. Entrance fee is $22/person and parking is $15 even with validation. Also, stay well away from the offered Cafe's, the prices are excessively high. $1.50 for a soda is well above the norm, and the pizza and other food looked like it had been sitting out from the day before. (Two sodas, a salad, a Ceaser chicken wrap, and a small cut veggies and ranch dip were over $20 - mind you, I know it helps support the aquarium, but oy.)Bottom Line: Try the fish... save the lemon. Plan to spend at least two hours." "7/10/2008"
"9" "4.0" "Really enjoyed my visit to this aquarium.  Glad that I arrived there early (around 9am) because it sure gets packed from 11 onwards.  I spent most of the day here because the aquarium is quite large with lots of interesting information!I think the layout of the aquarium was very good - you are directed (due to the location of the escalators) through most of the exhibits on each floor before proceeding to the next floor.Really enjoyed the tropical rain forest, although I wish I could've seen one of those monkeys from Brazil that look like lions (forgot the proper name of it atm).  They also have some interactive shark/stingray survival game on touchscreen monitors that are located throughout the floors... Even though it was a simple game... I found myself addicted to it as it was kinda challenging to keep my shark and stingray alive to beat the game.  I got to the halfway point (reached one side of the ocean.... lost trying to swim back, ugh!)  But I can definitely see this as a good way to keep kids appeased as they wait patiently for patrons to move away from crowded exhibits.The aquarium is really expensive (base price: ~$25 per person, more for shows} but I think it's worth seeing at least once.Based on what I remember at the NY Aquarium, I would say this one is better (except for the crowds).Tip: get there early! Tickets have entry times.  By the time I left the aquarium (around 1pm), there was a huge line at the ticket window and the next available entry time was for 3:15pm!!" "7/11/2011"
"10" "4.0" "The aquarium is one of the main events of Inner Harbor in Baltimore. I usually get here every few years; although, I do prefer the Science Center. The main downside is that aquarium is a bit pricey at $25 per person. It can also be a bit crowded, but that's not usually too big of a deal. The aquarium is quite large, and there's a lot to see. I think the exhibits and variety are quite good. However, I've only been to a handful of other aquariums, so I can't compare it too well. I especially enjoy the part at the very top of the museum where you go into a rain forest type of area." "9/2/2010"
"11" "4.0" "Buy your tickets in advance if you are coming on the weekend. The lines can be long and when it is hot it is especially tiring. This is a great place to take your kids but you cannot take a stroller into the aquarium." "9/10/2010"
"12" "4.0" "This is a great place to spend 2 hours.  I went on a weekday morning and it was great because it wasn't very crowded.  The exhibits were educational, and there's a large variety of things to see.  If you want to see the dolphins from above (as opposed to just seeing them swiim underwater), you'll need to pay extra to see the show.  I'm a bit spoiled by how great the Monterey Bay Aquarium (in CA) is so I was a little disappointed that they special jellyfish exhibit didn't contain any of the large ones." "4/13/2011"
"13" "3.0" "A must-see while you're in the area.  Admission is expensive and the wait can be long so try buying tickets in advanced and try finding discounts online or through AAA beforehand.  Nice exhibits.  In the heart of the aquarium is a large tank for the sharks, sting rays, loggerhead turtles, and the occasional sucba diver.  The Australia exhibit had cool species yet not super impressive, though I was wary of talking under the canopies since the birds on exhibit are free-flying (and who knows what kind of surprises they can leave you).  For extra fare you can check out the dolphin show.My favorite part is the frogs exhibit, with many terrariums of different species of colorful-and-tiny-yet poisonous tropical frogs.  They're so pretty and cute I wish I coudl've take some home with me.  And my goodness those bullfrogs are squishy fat!  It seems like this place is expansive in space with exhibits that minimally fill up the space.  Can't say this place is too cluttered.Ideal location in the Inner Harbor with plenty of places to walk around and check out while waiting for your entry time." "7/16/2006"
"14" "3.0" "OK. Not that great. For the national aquarium I expected more." "11/6/2011"
"15" "5.0" "Good time. Clean and friendly staff. I did enjoy the exhibits, but I have seen better Aquariums.  Still enjoyed." "10/16/2010"
"16" "5.0" "The shark tank makes this place! You can stand in the center while the sharks circle - it is just entirely to cool. Amazonia is also one of the neatest exhibits ever. I use to work next door to here when I was in college and considered myself a regular. I still like to go but try to avoid it during the summer months.  This and the Aquarium Philly/Camden are two of the best in country. It is not cheap but it is so totally worth the ticket price.I don't think this place is just for kids and some of the stuff is really beyond a lot of younger kids. I think it has a lot to offer anyone interested in nature and wildlife - but - keep if you come on the wrong day it is crawling with school groups and loud badly behaved groups of roving middle schoolers." "9/10/2008"
"17" "4.0" "I've been to alot of aquariums and this one is by far the biggest!  We spent at least 3 hours here, there was so much to see.  I loved the bird room and the tropical rain forest.  I highly recommend this aquarium." "4/7/2009"
"18" "5.0" "Pretty cool. There's a lot of stuff if you're into it. The Australian exhibit is especially cool because of the waterfall and the glass structure. I've been going here over ten years, and the changes and renovations have been really good. Recently, they've stopped the dolphin show, which is sad. It's was a really good show when it was running." "8/3/2012"
"19" "2.0" "Woohoo go Dolphins!!! You guys are some very smart water loving mammals with attitude and personality! I can't believe, as a native Marylander (not exactly Baltimorean) I hadn't been to a dolphin show until adulthood, really it's a shame." "1/27/2010"
"20" "4.0" "Too expensive, too crowded, walkways are entirely too narrow, and the people there will actually SHOVE children out of the (too small) viewing windows.   C'mon, people!   The aquarium is for the kids!  Share and play nice.Make the drive up to Philly.... the aquarium there is MUCH nicer.   Trust me." "6/22/2008"
"21" "4.0" "I haven't been to many other aquariums but I've come here every few years since I was in preschool and it becomes more enjoyable every time.Two characteristics stand out to me.  One, the displays at the National Aquarium feature concise and interesting facts about each organism.  Two, the animals are easy to find.The Animal Planet Australia: Wild Extremes temporary exhibit was a great surprise.  We found many animals unknown to other zoos in the area, including 'living fossils' shield shrimp and lungfish, as well as archerfish and swimming lizards.  The Immersion Theater was exciting enough for kids but played an engaging Planet Earth piece that would interest adults as well.Great family outing or date for any animal lover.  Additionally, a great chance to learn for anyone willing to linger and read the signs." "5/27/2008"
"22" "4.0" "It was $25(we bought admission to the dolphin show). It was really crowded the day we went and I think that really changes the feel of the place. Unfortunately, My friend was also feeling really sick so we ended up not waiting out the long lines and sorta glanced over what we could see. From what I did see it is amazing. I have been to the aquarium in Boston as well and while both offer different attraction's Baltimore Aquarium is waaaaay worth it. I also suggest seeing the Dolphin Show-for an extra $5 it is worth it. TIP: If you go in the winter try to stash your jackets elsewhere-there was a huge line to do coatcheck and carrying them around with us was a pain-especially when we went through the tropical zones. It was hot!" "1/22/2009"
"23" "4.0" "I am only giving this 4 stars because the 5 star standard is the Monterey Bay aquarium.  This is a great aquarium to spend a day at.  The rays and sharks exhibit is especially good.  We stood there for a long time just fascinated by the green turtle and rays.  Some of the complaints about the lack of colorful fish are baffling to me - why does a fish have to be tropical to be interesting or worth learning about?  In many ways it seems to me that the native fish exhibits are more valuable because it teaches visitors about the wildlife they directly impact with their decisions and actions.  Our kids particularly enjoyed the dolphin show, Australia exhibit, and rainforest exhibits in addition to the standard aquarium offerings.  As mentioned, there are no strollers allowed and a fair amount of walking, so plan accordingly.  Also, if you arrive and park prior to 9:30am on a weekday, you'll beat the crowds and pay less that half the regular garage price on an \"early bird\" special.  10 bucks to park for a whole day downtown is not bad at all.  We did not eat at the cafeteria in the aquarium, why would you when there are so many easily accessible eating options in easy walking distance?" "6/27/2011"
"24" "4.0" "i went awhile ago and am just getting around to reviewing this now, so forgive my generalizations. this would be five stars if i wasn't able to easily tour this place in a couple of hours but i was. with that said, there's a lot in the way of sea life to check out. from all the hype, i expected something like wall-to-wall fish tanks, but they're sort of divided, with some being pretty huge and others not. anyway, they were still super cool and i super loved looking at the sting rays that swam sort of underneath everybody, although i nearly had a coronary thinking that my tot would somehow manage to jump in with them. we also attended the dolphin show--even though i'm against their captivation...again, it was nice for what it was, but it still seemed on the smaller side of what i expected and i felt bad for their having to be stuck inside of their small-ish tanks. the thing that made this place tolerable with tot-in-tow was all of the affordable places to eat at (such as panara bread--great atmosphere and decent eats on a dime) and perusing some of the more affordable franchise places that dc lacks like footwear.the harbor is pretty, but again--it seemed sort of smallish compared to what i had expected it to be. not a waste of money by far and i might take my tot here again one day when he's older." "5/9/2011"
"25" "3.0" "Purchased a Couple's package they had going on in February. Included tickets for the 4D (not 3D) movie and Dolphin show which we skipped out on because it was so crowded. Not my cup of tea anyway but the option was nice. My boyfriend and I went on our own little tour of the place. I love the bubble tubes! The giant open top tank was awesome, gave me goosebumps thinking I could fall in. The shark exhibit was my favorite. Going down the long ramps and seeing all the different sharks. I've been to plenty of aquariums in my day (most frequently the Waikiki in Hawaii) and the National has the best shark exhibit i've seen. I loved seeing the shark with the long jagged tooth sword face... whatever its called... it was really awesome. The jellyfish exhibit was slightly disappointing but beyond that it was still pretty neat aquarium. Spent a good three hours there. Food court could be better. Still had an amazing time :) The keepsake photo they take when you first arrive is great, lol. The boyfriend thought it was a photo to keep track of all the guests incase one gets lost, turns out its a souvenir photo you purchase at the end." "4/2/2011"
"26" "4.0" "The place is very nice. But, It wasnt really what i expected when i got there. Most of the animals were very small and not very close. Tickets aren't cheap and some of the fish were \"off\" that day." "9/23/2011"
"27" "4.0" "Wow, this was a maze of funness!  I never knew what was coming next. There are so many different types of animals that they feature. It's not all marine life. I loved the different atmospheres as well. Dessert, rainforest...it's all so great!  I also love the location, right on the water...so appropriate.  We went on a Saturday...super duper packed...so if you're looking to have some space and have the room to get a great look at all they have to offer...don't go on a weekend.  We spend over 2 hours roaming and learning and just having a great experience. There are different shows and movies to go to as well...we didn't do them, but they looked pretty cool.  There's also a place to eat inside if you choose but there are tons of restaurants outside the aquarium as well.  Once you have your tickets you're free to come and go. The one thing I do have a complaint about it the picture they take of you when you first arrive. At the end before you leave, you can \"preview\" it...which means that they print it out in an 8x10, 4x5 and 2 wallets...you cant buy just one or two of the pictures...if you want any of them, you have to buy the complete set...seriously...who really needs 4 pictures of the same thing?!?!  And if you choose not to buy it...they just THROW THEM AWAY!!!! such a waste! I definetly think there is a better option and they would probably have more takers if you could choose the size that best fits your needs...just saying!But yeah, we had a great time and were very happy with what we saw. I loved the jelly fish...its my favorite exhibit :)" "12/17/2010"
"28" "4.0" "This aquarium is situated right on the Harbor and is a very beautiful set up.  It seems to be geared very much toward education as opposed to entertainment and they have devoted a section to Chesapeake Bay marine life, which is interesting to get that local info. I have to admit that it is not nearly as beautiful nor with as impressive displays at those of the Ripley Aquarium in Pigeon Forge Tennessee nor is it as hands-on as the Aquarium in Sarasota FL.  But despite this, if you enjoy fish and learning it is a great aquarium.  A few years back they had an absolutely exquisite display of jelly fish which I wish they had made a permanent display.  The tanks seem a little small and the selection of fish also seems a bit limited.  I agree that the dolphin show had maybe a bit too much video and talking (the education part) and not enough of the dolphins playing and showing their stuff--which is what we wanted to see...but the fact that they have a dolphin show at all was pretty cool.  I recently saw the frog exhibit they have and think that also probably should become a permanent display.  What could go away and be made into a more effective and interesting exhibit is the upstairs Australia exhibit.  It was pretty disappointing except for the crocs...all 4 who were stuck in a tank about 8 feet long.We live nearby and knew that we would come back again and again to enjoy this is as a day off getaway.  For that reason we purchased membership tickets which are good for the whole year and will definitely be worth the price for us (about $99).  We do still have to pay extra to see the dolphins and also to do the 4D theater, but even with that the price is right if you're someone who likes to take your time and watch the animals.  Also, you don't have to wait in the long line for one time admission but get to enter through the member's entry.  As a member you also are invited to special activities at the aquarium.The 4D theater is pretty cool...but the features are short.Wish they had some big tanks filled with lots of beautiful fish and BENCHES where people could sit and enjoy.  This aquarium is a very busy place and a SATURDAY OR SUNDAY is a miserable time to go unless you like being squished and pushed around by hundreds of rude children who don't know how to even say excuse me or to wait their turn.  We usually go on a Friday during the afternoon and if we want to stay we can...during the summer months we could potentially be there until 10 PM.We also enjoy the rainforest atrium (again, benches for bird watchers would be nice!)."

"30" "4.0" "Well I've been to many aquariums. There aren't that many unique underwater animals here..I expected a children's underwater petting place, such as, starfish, sea slugs for people to touch, but i didn't see any. I was most impressed with the giant octopus however." "6/11/2010"
"31" "5.0" "I wish the Dolphin Show could be a little longer but obviously a crowd pleaser!" "8/13/2012"
"32" "3.0" "OMG I love this place, it is so cool" "6/22/2011"
"33" "5.0" "So many people feel that this aquarium is the best place on earth and we all know that's not the case.  Maybe I'm the only one who knows where the best place on earth truly is.  Hmmmm.Isn't an aquarium about getting lost in the undersea world and watching discovery across peoples faces??   For me it was a birth control advertisement with fish inside.  When you first walk in the shark exhibit, it grabs you somewhat.... you see the rays swimming with some sharks peppered throughout the tank. It's a good exhibit and one that can be viewed from above and from below as well. The whale skeleton hanging over top was pretty cool. The Jelly Invasion exhibit, while a rotating exhibit, was small and not good at all. The line was long to get funneled into a little room with not much return on investment.  The planet earth 4d theater is horrible.  I'm not trying to be shocking here but it has that dirty class trip smell and the water spraying on you as you watch the movie feels really gross...  like Pee Wee Herman is behind you enjoying the Empire Penguins a little too much.  I loved the dolphin show and discovered that I DO love dolphins and they aren't just happy sharks. The Australian exhibit was OK too. I can't say I disliked the place, I did enjoy it but it wasn't this shrine to the ocean that its portrayed to be.   Grubs ~" "8/11/2010"
"34" "5.0" "The aquarium was WONDERFUL!!  I didn't have as much time there as I would have wished, but really enjoyed it.  A couple things I wish I knew:(1)  On crowded days, they issue you an entrance time with your ticket.  On the Saturday we were there, we bought tickets around 12:30 and didn't get to go in until 2:45!  Yikes!  Luckily, you don't have to wait in line - you can walk around the inner harbor (or go have lunch like we did!) and just come back at/after you ticket time.(2)  They do offer AAA discounts on tickets but not AT the aquarium - you have to buy them ahead of time (at the AAA office or online maybe?).Getting inside is a little crazy - the whole aquarium i think is sort of designed to go through in one \"line\"...the way the exhibits and such are set up, it's very sequential.  Which is okay, but when it's crowded (like on Saturdays in the summer), it gets a little crazy.  If I go back, I would try to go on an off-day.But the exhibits are wonderful!  I almost skipped the Australian exhibit, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.  (Pig nosed turtles!!!)  All the docents were very friendly and helpful in pointing out animals, giving information and answering questions. The sting-ray tank.  The shark tank.  The tropical exhibit.  The poison tree frogs.  All awesome.I loved the aquarium and I didn't even have time to see the dolphins!!  (I KNOW!!!)  So I can only imagine that what I saw + dolphins makes this place absolutely five star worthy."

"36" "4.0" "I thought this was the highlight to our baltimore visit last year. I was here when I was a kid, but didnt really remember that. it costs 25 dollars, but theres usually a discount you can print our from the internet or the entertainment guide. it was a great place, they had four different areas where you could explore, a dolphin area where they did dances and so forth, it was alright, that costs like 10 dollars extra to see the show. they had the jungle area where it was all about snakes & frogs. then they had the aquarium itself where you could see all the fish and stuff like that, manatees and then they had a big area that was open it was like the rainforest, with birds, spiders, stuff like that. interesting to note: Clyde Peeling's reptileland in allenwood, pa. did a lot of the frog & reptile exhibits." "2/21/2008"
"37" "3.0" "This aquarium is located right in the Inner Harbor and has a wonderful display of sea life and birds.  If the ticket price is too expensive, try going on Fridays after 5 when the ticket price drops to $8 (if I remember correctly) with the dolphin show for another $3.  The aquarium is small and you can probably get through it in 2 hours.  It's nothing like the Monteray Bay Aquarium, but if you go when they have the deal, it's VERY worth it." "1/12/2008"
"38" "2.0" "I love aquariums and read this place was once rated number 1 in the nation so I had to go.  This place is definitely better than the Seattle Aquarium but that's not saying much.  I came on a Columbus Day so the place was packed full of kids.  I wish the dolphin show and the 4D movie was included in the regular admission but  you have to pay an extra $5 for that.  My favorite part was seeing all the different sting rays and sharks." "10/24/2010"
"39" "4.0" "OK, so people complain that they have to pay 18 dollars for a ticket to Philadelphia Zoo. How about paying 30 and basically, having not much to see? It is a great place to go during a hot, hot humid summer (well, basically every summer here in Maryland qualifies). Aquarium serves as a great cool AC. It is dark there, crowds are ginormous  (try to see some exhibits over a company of active screaming excited kids! Good luck with that, crowds are plenty there). Speaking of the exhibits, it is not much to see there, I've seen more in some small Florida local aquariums for the fraction of a price. The only thing that goes for Baltimore aquarium, besides AC, is a cool, cool, extremely cool building. It is beautiful inside, when you are descending the ramp, seeing all the fish swimming by as you walk, like in a giant marine beltway. Stingray tank is good as well. Rainforest area is just blah. Dolphin show is double blah with a sour cream on top. Pretty pitiful. We had a membership one year, went there twice and completely lost any interest." "7/19/2012"
"40" NA "The aquarium is really good and well maintained. The variety of species is great. I especially liked the sharks and small exotic sea creatures. The dolphin show was really boring (in comparison with the Miami seaquarium dolphin show). The entire show was about aquarium's efforts in preserving the dolphins' population and about some unique features of dolphins (all narrated). They showed couple of things that dolphins could do - clapping their fins, making sounds, and one dolphin jumped just once. Then they invited \"special\" guests (VIP I presume) to see the dolphins closer while the rest of the audience was wondering what was going on. I thought it wasn't the best way to conduct the show. All in all, the show sucked. We didn't have a chance to see the 4D movie, but hopefully next time. Parking was a rip-off (20 dollars), and the pretzels that they sell on their food court were horrible. Bottom line: go strait to see the jelly fish and Australia exhibit, skip the dolphin show and finish with sharks. The surrounding area is very nice and there are lots of nice restaurants."
