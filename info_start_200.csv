"2" "4.0" "Surprised my son with a visit here for his birthday.  Compared to the one in DC, DC has got nothing on Baltimore.  It is massive and super fun!  My birthday boy could not stop seeing the various exhibits.  From Calypso the green sea turtle to the rainforest!  This aquarium was worth every penny to see the smile on my sons face.It is a but pricey, I am sure if I had gotten the membership it would be MUCH cheaper.  The location of the aquarium is excellent, with views of the harbor.  Their Dolphin discovery exhibit is another worthwhile thing to see.  This is fun for all kids and grownups!" "7/2/2012"
"3" "4.0" "I do enjoy the Nat Aquarium.  We've been several times.  It changes every year or so, so that there's always something new to experience.  Today we did immersion tours and it changed the entire experience.  I will do my best to describe it all, quickly:Basic admission - if we had ONLY done the basic admission today we probably would not have enjoyed it.  LOTS of exhibits and cool stuff but man was that place packed.  At one point, we overheard an employee saying that so far they were above 6400 visitors... even the employees were shocked at the attendance.  You had to fight your way to every exhibit.  Normally, we go during the week (since we have kids that's normally in the summer) when it's less crowded and I recommend that.Rain forest exhibit-4 stars  (I would have rated it a 3 because I have seen better - specifically the RF exhibit in the SF Science Museum, which I also did a YELP review for... but I gave it a 4 because my 2 kids -7yo boy & 10yo girl - both said this and the Austrailian exhibit were their 2nd favorite exhibits)Austrailian exhibit - VERY similar to Rain forest exhibit, also 4 stars.Jellies - Might be my fav part, only because it's the only time I have ever thought Jelly Fish were beautiful. 4 stars (only because everyone else may not be as tickled that that idea as I am; and it's usually crowded)Sharks - I LOVE their shark exhibits, it's also the \"fav\" exhibit of both my 7 yr old son and my not 7 yr old husband.  The first time we took my then 4 yr old son he refused to walk down the ramp among the shark tank.  5 starsBlack tip shark reef - separate from the other shark areas, this is the newest exhibit. It's super cool and not just sharks.  We loved the big sea turtle, too.  5 starsDolphins - as you will read, we got up close and personal today but they do \"shows\" which are fun, we caught part of one.  You can also see the dolphins most any time you want so you can wander in and check them out as a regular exhibit whenever.  I do love dolphins.  Not rating since it can't compare to the special tour we did.There's not a boring part of the aquarium, it's all super cool, esp if you are either REALLY into this stuff or hardly ever see these kinds of animals.  We're sort of in the middle.The food at the cafe was also wonderful. As an aside, the environment (inner harbor) is a great place to hang out and site see.NOW for the good stuff...Dolphin Encounter... I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift.   It is EXPENSIVE... esp when you have to pay for a second expensive ticket just to be able to to and watch up close and take pics.  But... O. M. G. this was worth it for real.  I don't think my daughter knows how lucky she is to have had this opportunity.  She was \"petting\" and touching the dolphin, playing catch and coxing the dolphin to dance and do all kinds of things.  I was thrilled just to be able to capture it all on video.  VERY EXPENSIVE and worth every dime if you can swing it without sacrificing buying groceries that week. WOW.  500 stars.**Unexpected Bonus:  The Dolphin Encounter starts before the building opens.  Two of us were doing that, but there were 4 in our party.  They let my son and husband in to roam even though the entire place was not open.  They say that was the highlight of their day.  No crowds, about 20 people in the building.  Super cool.  Esp important as we said it was extra crowded today.  They also said the coolest coolest thing was that only some of the lights were on in the shark exhibit so when they first saw a shark it seemed to come out of the darkness.  They said it was down right WICKED, and it was the highlight of their day.Shark Encounter... Since we could not afford to do the dolphin encounter for my son, too, I had to come up with something special he could do.  The shark encounter was the pick.  Less expensive, but still not cheap.  I was told that you'd walk across a catwalk inches above the shark tank during feeding time and there would be lots of excitement.  Yes, you walk across a catwalk inches above the shark tank - and it's very \"back stage\" because you see all the filters and such, but because of the filters and water movement you can't see the sharks that well.  And I did not see anyone feeding the sharks.  I felt like it was a bit of a rip off and was disappointed.  This is esp true since the cost to do that includes your admission to the museum, which the dolphin encounter also included so I basically paid for 2 admissions we didn't use.  I asked if we could get anything to compensate (lunch? something?  NO, NOTHING).  It should not be called the shark encounter.  It should be called a back stage tour.  You see the animal quarrantine areas, the lab, the filters, etc.  It's cool, and you learn a lot, but it is NOT what was represented to me.  1 star on this.  Sorry."

"4" "4.0" "It's a great place for family fun and learning. Although they don't have like a major variety of animals for what they do have is awesome and it is quite a bit. Only thing i did not like was the fact that it was wayyyy over crowded. I kept getting scared id lose one of my 3 boys. The prices for admission is high but we ended up buying the membership seeing it was only $30 more than what we would have spent for the day so now we can go whenever we feel like it. One thing i absolutely didn't like was the parking we took the whole family which we took 3 cars and each car spent $27. I'm told theres a special parking for the aquarium  but i don't know the area so i'd have to look for it.   Other than that its pretty great and fun for the kids." "7/2/2014"
"5" "5.0" "Great time here! The staff was super friendly. It is very clean. The layout was great. No huddles of people crowding around. The flow of traffic was smooth and fast. The aquarium is HUGE. I loved the multi level tanks. As you walk down each level, you hit the fishies until you hit the bottom level with the sharks! Upstairs is the rain forest, complete with monkeys and birds. I loved my visit here. It was very impressive. Don't flash the octopus!" "7/8/2012"
"6" "1.0" "definitely had a blast here today. big, bright, clean exhibits and happy looking animals. love love love the jellyfish tanks. helpful staff everywhere. a little pricey for foods but hey that's what youll get at this type of place. lots of places to view the animals, since it was quite busy there. was a great day trip and very educational!" "6/29/2014"
"7" "4.0" "I've been wanting to come here for years! I never was able to go because other plans got in the way. I heard SO many great things about it.. I just wanted to experience it for myself! This year I was finally taken. I was disappointed and I won't ever make a trip back. I came here on a Sunday, which I didn't expect it to be so crowded with people, but it was.. No big deal though, everywhere will be like that. I didn't expect it to be as short of a tour as it was. It took us an hour and a half to go through the aquarium. It had great facts behind every animal/creature, but I couldn't stand there, people were crowding into the same tiny spaces making it difficult to read anything. It just wasn't a fun experience as I thought.. I've been to MUCH better aquariums." "9/5/2012"
"8" "3.0" "I'll admit it - I'm a sucker for aquariums and zoos.  The best birthday gifts I've had in the past two years have been my year-long membership to the Shedd Aquarium in 2011 and the Brookfield Zoo in 2012.  So when I went to visit some family in the Baltimore area in August of 2012, one of the obligatory stops for me was to the National Aquarium.  Location: 5 out of 5 (for tourists)Of COURSE the National Aquarium has to be located in the general harbor area.  I mean...where would it be otherwise, right?  I actually like the harbor area because if you start walking on one end at around Pier 5 all the way around the where the Rusty Scupper is and then back, it's actually a fairly pleasant walk.  Parking was plentiful at the main parking complex at Pier 5, though I would suggest that you make a full day of being in the area since it was over 20 dollars for a flat \"daily\" fee.  Buses and the light rail are viable options, of course - but we were coming from the 'burbs in a rental car.Layout: 3 out of 5Sorry, national aquarium - although I understand the reasoning behind having to split exhibits up into different buildings and the necessity behind making the most of your vertical space so that you can fit more into less...the overall layout can be a little distracting, especially if you start asking yourself, \"oh wait...did we walk there yet?\"  And since there are a few areas that don't seem to have a clear flow of traffic direction, you run the risk of running into the small children that are running afoot (in the wrong direction).  Was it fun to go up the escalators and take in things at a relaxing pace, and was it neat to walk over one of the sky bridges over the water?  It sure was, and I'm not complaining about my experience at the aquarium - it just wasn't my personal preference for how it was laid out.  Also - if you're walking from Pier 5, you'll run into one of the auxiliary buildings first before the main entrance.  Don't be bummed out, but instead - try to walk to the \"front\" and you'll see the ticket windows.  Aside from the physical layout, the aquarium was laid out in a manner that made sense:  freshwater fish were in the same general area, the rainforest area was isolated from the rest of the building, salt water fish were in another, and admittedly - the big tank holding all of the sharks and schools of large fish was incredibly impressive (but the review of this metric goes somewhere else). Variety and quality of exhibits: 5 out of 5No complaints in this department.  Upon walking in, you're greeted with a cool (temperature and metaphorically) waterfall area where you can get some pictures (serves as a queuing area when times are busy, I assume), and then you're off into the main part of the aquarium.  The biggest draw, I imagine - is the open tank in the middle of the main building that has the sea turtle missing one flipper.  That turtle is actually pretty awesome.  Commensurate with other great aquariums in the country, you'll find a large selection of ocean creatures, stream creatures, pond creatures, lake creatures, and even some land creatures like the turtle that was hanging out in the rain forest exhibit.  They also have a few sloths in that exhibit, but unfortunately - s/he was not interested in making an appearance on the day I was there.  I'm not sure if the jellyfish exhibit is permanent or rotating, but it was probably the exact one that we had in Chicago for awhile.  As I mentioned earlier, the huge tank holding sharks and other Caribbean type fish was impressive - some fish were super twitchy and fast, others liked to swim together in a slow promenading manner, and then there were some that were just hanging out and resting.  I believe that admission covers their version of the dolphin demonstration, but I've seen so many of those that it was...ok to skip.  Amenities and cleanliness: 4 out of 5No complaints here, either.  Restrooms were plentiful, and elevators for those needing them were easily visible.  There were a few places to eat that either sold items or allowed you to bring them in, and the place was kept extremely clean.  Price: 4 out of 5Admission for adults was 30 bucks each, which I think is about right for the caliber of things that you get to see along with the sheer number of things to observe.  I appreciated the self-serve payment kiosks that probably come in handy when you have huge groups of people.  Overall: 4 out of 5Very strong 4 star experience.  Lots to see, easy parking, and located in a very picturesque setting.  Strongly recommended for young couples, as well as families who have kids at an age where they're captivated by living creatures."

"9" "3.0" "This place was great as far as all the animals you get to see and learn about.  I absolutely love the touch screen information docks. The sharks and dolphins are awesome and the jellyfish are mesmerizing. However, I have to give 3 stars. One star off because of the Awful customer service by the older, shorter gentleman standing at the entrance checking tickets. Why have him at the FRONT? Im sure he was hired for a reason but he definitely does not leave a customer feeling welcome or even respected. Another star off because of the poor signage when you enter (I can get over that) and for the super spaced out 4D shows that the ticket agent told me lasts 15 mins. Either that is not the real length of the show or there is a ridiculously long break after each show. I ended up not going because I didnt want to wait 40 minutes after I had toured the aquarium for the show to start." "5/22/2014"
"10" "2.0" "The National Aquarium in Baltimore is very nice.  It is large, plenty of exhibits to keep you occupied.  They jellyfish exhibit was my favorite... and the sharks, can't forget the sharks!  I also enjoyed the tortoises in the \"rainforest\" part of the aquarium.It gets very crowded here on the weekends to the point where you have to wait to get up close to see the fish.  That being said, I would try and come here on a weekday if possible.  In addition, with all the bodies in this place, it gets very hot a muggy.  Definitely dress in layers.  At one point I thought I was going to pass out.Overall this is a fun outing and I would recommend it to those in the area.  It may not be as good as the Boston Aquarium, but it's still fun!" "6/13/2012"
"11" "4.0" "we went to the aquarium looking forward to the dolphin show with my husb and our 4 boys 13,10,4 and 3 the drive from Philly was long 2hr with back to back traffic altho we did leave later than expected 10:30am.our entrance time had a 31/2 hr time delay with sold out dolphin show! we were all so upset.I wish i would have booked online.when we finally got in we were shocked at the $3.99 small gatorade and over priced food at the cafeteria!without the dolphin show we think the adventure aquarium in Camden is better for kids because they have penquins outside,hippos and a petting rays part Baltimore one doese not.on a good note our 4:15 time slot wasnt as crowded." "6/23/2014"
"12" "3.0" "I love the whole set up.  A beautiful modern take on an Aquarium." "6/10/2014"
"13" "5.0" "Love the Sharks, and entry way. The aquarium does however have an uncomfortable and difficult to get around in layout. If you have toddlers or younger, this may not be the place for you. The aquarium is quite pricy and if you are only going to spend a couple of hours there, I suggest going elsewhere. If you are a nature enthusiast and love sea creatures, this is a great place to go. If you have small kids who may not have the greatest attention span, maybe you should pass on this VERY expensive ticket. The habitats are very well done and practically take you to another land. I really enjoyed the dolphins and that sharks. My kids loved the sharks and jellyfish. I would love to go again, but may not be so willing to spend the money on the ticket until my boys are older." "6/27/2013"
"14" "5.0" "The National Aquarium is great! The layout of the whole aquarium is so unique and makes the experience even more exciting. The Jellies Invasion is by far my favorite. Can't wait to to go back, hopefully for Dollar Days again this year!" "12/4/2014"
"15" "4.0" "Well set up, not too impressed with gift shop." "5/3/2014"
"16" "5.0" "Dive right in!Giant sea turtle (missing a fin), emerald boa, flipping dolphins, and sword shark!Incredible space, incredible exhibits. Only thing keep it form 5 stars is the $30 price tag. The most expensive museum/exhibit in the area. Ouch!" "7/8/2012"
"17" "5.0" "My friends in Baltimore told me that this is the best aquarium in the nation.  I had my doubts because I have been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and was completely impressed .  Well, both aquariums are most impressive.  Far better then your local fish places.  They are leading the way on education and conservation.  You are missing out if you skip over this when you visit Baltimore." "9/21/2013"
"18" "5.0" "Amazing! Would recommend this to anyone! The staff even helped us avoid all the school field trip students." "10/29/2014"
"19" "4.0" "One of my favorite aquariums. It IS kind of pricey but I think it's well worth it." "9/5/2013"
"20" "4.0" "I came here thinking \"once you've seen the Monterey Bay Aquarium, all other aquariums are just tanks of water with fish.\" But this aquarium proved me wrong, sure they had a small section of Pacific Ocean ecology but getting to see the Atlantic Ocean ecology was pretty cool too. I also didn't realize this aquarium was so huge! There's a whole dolphin arena if you take the sky bridge to the other building! We got to see the divers feeding the fish & sharks in the main atrium area; the divers were incredibly engaging during the feeding. The other cool thing was the Amazon rain forest; there are bats hanging from the net at the top of the giant room, birds and the funny long neck turtles swimming around. There was also an employee feeding the archerfish with a live cricket on a long stick - the fish would spit to hit the cricket and make it fall in to the water so they could eat it. THAT was pretty fun to see! We spent a good 3 or 4 hours there. It just goes to show that things like aquariums aren't necessarily kid & family exclusive places." "1/7/2014"
"21" "5.0" "I love this Aquarium. I'm a huge fan of animals, so whenever we go to a new state, my boyfriend and I try to go to the zoo or aquarium to see what it's like for that state. We first got to the Aquarium and waited on line for tickets (which is way TOO overpriced..34$/person) and unfortunately the customer representative behind the counter was rude. Tya, as her name tag said, didn't make eye contact with either me or my boyfriend as she sold us the tickets. Instead she stared straight ahead and it was as if we didn't exist. Despite this we had a pleasant experience with other staff and didn't let this bother us. Upon entering there was a deck where you could view the harbor and it was beautiful! All the buildings on the other side of the water and the submarine was a plus. Every floor had its own dedication. Being a turtle fan, I was extremely excited about this floor. I loved the fact that the aquarium could be seen on all levels. The sting rays here are the biggest I've ever seen!!! And all different colors and patterns :D My favorite part was with the jelly fish invasion. They have a large cafeteria on the main floor and on small one on an upper level floor if you get hungry during the day there though I did not notice the price of the food at this venue. The exhibits were all very nice and most animals could be viewed though of course people crowded around the more popular displays. The exit may be one of the better ones I have seen from a place like this as it has views of all the animals as you are going back down to the main floor without having to retrace the path you took to the top which was very nice and unique. The dolphin show was quite nice, learning about them was a plus, however, when the presenter was speaking she was a bit muffled and hard to hear. The Australian exhibit was  nice. I like the nature/forest setup, felt like the great outback :) Overall a very nice Aquarium and well worth the trip." "9/26/2014"
"22" "4.0" "I think this is my favorite aquarium on the east coast. It's definitely a toss up between here and the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta each has their own area's where they really excel. However I think the Baltimore Aquarium has the edge. There are so many things to see here at any given time that I'm not even going to try and describe them all to you. To really get a thorough look at the place I suggest you get there in the early afternoon and plan to spend about 4 hours there at the least. That should give you ample time to check out the most interesting exhibits and take in the dolphin show. Then you can hit the Inner Harbor for a meal. If you can, order your tickets in advance online. It will save you a few dollars and a lot of time and hassle as I've seen walk ups turned away or told they have to wait. Also consider visiting during the off season. The crowds can be very large during the summer." "11/10/2010"
"23" "4.0" "We had a ball at the Baltimore National Aquarium ..it was awesome, its nice to be able to see some of gods beautiful creations in one place and to see how the aquarium take such good care of them...its a must see!" "10/28/2013"
"24" "2.0" "Great for children.  Good for 2 -3 hours.  Plan on taking a break mid-way.  Leave the facility and eat at restaurant outside for superior food.  Get a hand stamp for re-entry.We had entry tickets for 11 AM on a Sunday.  Would recommend getting in early and during the week if possible as it does get crowded!  We did not have a choice since we were coming from Falls Church, VA via Poolesville, MD.Keep a close watch on the little ones since there are lots of chilldren struggling to get close to the many exhibits.Dress light as the humidity is high and the temperatures are warm, partially due to the abundance of glass!My only complaint was that we when to 2 dolphin shows.  The first involved hitting ice to them as an enrichment activity!  Totally boring to both the audience and the dolphins.  Members of the audience were walking out before the end of the show and two of the six dolphins had stopped participating soon after the \"show\"  had started.  The next show was more entertaining!  Glad we went back.  While I understand this is not Seaworld the Aquarium needs to understand people do come for entertainment and not JUST Education! Was here two years ago and think it may be a while before we return.  Maybe when my grand son is older and better behaved!PS..Adult Prices are $34.95 plus $1.95 on line processing fee rather than the $25 mentioned by another reviewer!!  Child was $21.95 plus $1.95 fee!  Expensive when taking a group!" "7/1/2013"
"25" "5.0" "(This is about visiting the aquarium on a Friday after Five.)First off let's get rid of two big lies that you locals in Baltimore keep spreading:1.  That going after 5pm on a Friday is somehow \"great\".Sure it's great if you love lines, rude people, queues and not being able to see anything.  The price is awesome but it comes with huge drawbacks that no one seems capable to tell the truth about.2.  That the dolphin show is somehow \"worth it\".3/4 of the show is watching eco-propaganda on video screens.The dolphin show this past Friday barely made twenty minutes and the time of actual dolphin activity was closer to maybe four minutes.Everything was screwed up and chaotic from lining up outside for admission until way after five, not having one of the escalators working, pushing cheesy admission pictures on everybody that slowed everything down by the entrance, to not having any staff visible anywhere except for at the dolphin show.I've been to the aquarium many other times and while I realize it can get crowded, the fact the so many local yelpers refuse to actually let others know about the huge crowds that are normally there on Fridays after five, I asked what staff I could find and they all said that it's a zoo after five weekly particularly in bad weather, really does everybody a disservice.Because unless you love lines, queues, being pushed around and crowds, you'd be an idiot to go during this time." "3/3/2012"
"26" "4.0" "REVIEW OF A FISH-LOVER and CROWD-HATER:If you are an enthusiast of marine life, I would highly highly recommend you come here.  There are a LOT of different displays, from smaller tanks to giant recreated habitats and a wide spectrum of freshwater and saltwater creatures. The jellyfish exhibit was also fantastic.  Overall the place has a beautiful atmosphere.  The $25ish admission is so worth it (we did not do the 4D movie or the dolphin show).One of my main intentions for my visit was to avoid crowds.  In my mind, crowds ruin the aquarium experience.  I came in at 4:30pm on a Monday and I think this was a wise decision.  The places 'closes' at 5pm but they don't kick people out until 6:30.  There were still people but not many, and we could explore the place at our leisure, and only dealt with one or two loud kids.  NOTE: The jellyfish exhibit closes a bit early, around 5:30ish.This is more than just an aquarium.  There is a an indoor rainforest that has tons of tropical plants.  And the Australia exhibit had a lot of birds and plant life, as well as frogs, snakes, and lizards.My friend and I spent a good 90 minutes here just taking our time and looking at all the exhibits.  You also get great views of the Baltimore harbor area.  Did I mention the cool ska-reggae music playing in the gift shop?  Seriously, GO HERE."

"27" "5.0" "Aquariums have always been one of my favorite places to go! That being said, this one is awesome. Lots of variety, lots of jellyfish, and dolphin shows too. Lots of things to see! Caution: the birds in the rainforest exhibit can and will poop on you!Cons: Food is overpriced (expected though), tickets are $35 (if you get a AAA discount get your tickets beforehand through AAA), and I went on a weekend so it was crowded to the point where I didn't feel like waiting almost ten minutes so see a certain tank."

"30" "4.0" "If you're remotely local you owe it to yourself to get a membership because you'll never see everything on a single day trip. The lay out is a little hodgepodge and not stroller friendly. It's important to check the screens thoughout the building to find out when feedings and talks are going on as they are some of the best parts and give you a chance to chat with the animal keepers. I do wish they showed more of their animal rescue and conservation programs in the building as that is the reason for their otherwise high looking admission cost for a non profit. Also be aware that some parts of the building Dolphins, Jellys, Rainforest and Australia close before the main exhibits so if you come in near the end the day you might miss things.  The new webcam is great."

"31" "5.0" "3.5 Stars.I thought it was a bit too crowded for a weekday & I did the advised thing and entered @ 3pm.  Its tough for me to walk due to accident, so getting around people was difficult, plus one of their moving walkways was down & it gave me a good workout to get up the incline but then it was working 10 mins later.Sharks were great as well as dolphins, though the show was a bit too short."

"32" "5.0" "This is my favorite attraction in the Inner Harbor, by far! The space is gorgeously situated on the water and the variety of activities and exhibits will have you coming back over and over again.This past Memorial Day, I went for my fourth time, and even though some of my favorite areas were under construction, there were plenty of other attractions within the Aquarium to see.One word of advice I do have for those wanting to spend a good bit of time at the aquarium--make sure to buy tickets ahead of time! We bought tickets the day before thinking we could just choose our entry time, and while there were very reasonable times left, there were a few that were already sold out!The National Aquarium is a must-see for anyone in the Inner Harbor area, and well worth the price of admission!"

"33" "2.0" "I love the Aquarium, and so does everyone else. Internationally,  Maryland attracts attention to their Aquarium. Over the years the facility as grown to offer a better assortment of Jungle birds, frogs, spiders and plants. The Dolphin show was always one of the best things to see, however over the years the prices have gone up and tickets sell out quick, so make sure to get their early or order online prior. You'll start by seeing the rays swimming throughout the tanks, and a mix of other fish. As you progress to the top of the facility you will ride escalators over their tanks, making the trips in between floors visually stimulating.Dolphins, Sharks, Fish, Jellies and so much more in the aquatic offerings at the National Aquarium. Once at the top you will get into a smaller bird, jungle plants and species . There is a much larger display of birds and other jungle life.There is food at the end of the fish mazes you'll end up running into it and you may exit the facility or re-enter to get back to a show or a different floor. Staff is awesome, and their dedication is amazing. You'll find some of the best knowledge through their tours. - Handicap accessible - Field-trip pricing is offered through their website, please refer to their website and book a head of time. - An excellent place to visit and a must during your stay in Baltimore. - Friday's offer discounted pricing for visiting after 5pm."

"34" "4.0" "We visited in April 2013.  I had visited 7 or 8 years ago and had a much better impression, but it appears things are not what they used to be.We had serious safety concerns with overcrowding, poor/nonexistent lighting, and lack of exit signage in the Aquarium. The Aquarium advises you that \"for the best experience\" you should visit during off peak hours. Due to our schedule, though, we really had no choice but to visit in the afternoon, on a Saturday, in the Spring - which I know is a busy time of year. We went in fully aware that it would be very crowded. What we found:- Extreme crowding far beyond any rational level. I am not a fire marshall, but I would be Very surprised if they were not exceeding fire code limits. Crowding was such that we skipped entire sections of the aquarium because we literally couldn't move or see any of the exhibits. There appears to be no way to measure the number of people in the Aquarium at any given time - no turnstiles, and we didn't see anyone using a click device.  They also do not stick to their timed ticket rules (which was good for us since we were a few minutes late, but not good for crowding).  They were letting in everyone who had a ticket for that day prior to the current time...so at 1pm, they were letting in anyone with a ticket timed from aquarium open to 1pm.- Dark, crowded exhibits with with virtually ZERO lighting. In some areas the small exhibit tanks provide virtually the only light. I was holding the hand of my three year old niece with an iron grip because I couldn't even see her head 3.5 feet in front of me - truly. I understand keeping the lights low for the animals, but there aren't even strip lights on the floor to show you where the floor ends and the wall begins.- insufficient exit signage. Multiple times the crowd was so large that I started wondering how I would get out if something happened - a fire, whatever. Looking around, especially in the area with the large staircase and shark tanks, I could see no signage. I'll admit It's possible I missed it, but when someone is consciously searching for the exit sign, shouldn't it be pretty immediately apparent?We did enjoy the fish we were actually able to see, and we also really enjoyed a dolphin training session that was unannounced, so the viewing area was half empty.If we were to ever go again, we would go right at the time the aquarium opens...but I would still be uncomfortable with the extreme darkness, inability to see anything other than the fish (including the kids), and lack of signage."

"36" "4.0" "We went Friday 09/10 in the afternoon.  Not too busy, but still relatively full.$25 base tickets per person.  The price goes up a couple bucks if you add the dolphin show (which I think is about 20 minutes long) and/or the 4D movie (which was either a Dora the Explorer cartoon or a Planet Earth movie).  We opted for the base tickets, and did the whole place in a little over 2 hours.  Block out at least that amount of time, maybe longer if you like to ooh and aah or you have kids with you.Our first stop was the open pool that housed rays, smaller sharks and the biggest 3-flippered turtle I've ever seen in my life.  This was a cool exhibit because you looked down on the large area where the wildlife was allowed to swim free.  They had a small presentation during our time there, where we saw geared up workers in the pool feeding and interacting with the fish.We also got up close and personal with sharks and other larger fish in an area where you walked down a meandering 3+-story oval ramp located inside an aquarium.  This was a surreal area because the aquarium surrounded you as you walked deeper and deeper in to the dark water, with sharks and schools of fish swimming by.  Very cool.The rainforest area included many windows of brightly hued poisonous frogs (some of which were the size of a small pinky fingernail!), snakes and then outside in to a moist jungle, complete with neon-plumed birds, sloths and waterfalls!The final stop was the Jellyfish exhibit.  Not as big as I was expecting, but oh the variety!!  This was a popular area, and located right by the dolphin exhibit.  The workers, walking through the exhibits and extremely helpful and knowledgeable, recommended we visit the jellyfish before the dolphin group let out so it wouldn't be so crowded.  Good call.This place is worth the admission price and is a highly recommended trip for any visiting tourist.  Try the Friday after 5pm special they're running through September and October - $5 admission (instead of $25).  Check their website for when they close on Friday evening just to be safe.  We would have totally gone for this deal if we didn't have 7pm dinner reservations already planned."

"37" "4.0" "This was worth the 40 min drive. The aquarium is not huge but the exhibits and interactive displays are awesome. The Tropical Rain Forrest is something you need to experience once inside. I did not stay long enough to see the dolphin show but next time I will. I heard its a must see event. It's located in a perfect spot on Baltimore's Inner Harbor. You can make a full day of your visit here. Plenty of other things to do once you leave from the aquarium. Great for kids and would make for great date fun. I'll definitely be back." "9/8/2013"
"38" "4.0" "The aquarium itself was awesome. The rain Forrest was definitely my favorite part. A little crowded but what else do you expect for a Saturday morning. The staff was great. Very knowledgable. I'm giving it 4 stars solely because most of the exhibits and good places don't open until 10:30 or 11. If you open at 9am to the public everything should be open at 9am! Just my opinion though." "4/27/2014"
"39" "4.0" "Everything that you want in an Aquarium...plus a little bit more.We recently went on a daytrip to this Aquarium. Although it was a bit crowded and I didn't really care for the layout of the place, it was a great experience and the aquarium had a lot of exhibits.They have everything from aquarium standards like sharks, rays and eels...to jelly fish, which you don't always see at an aquarium. An added plus was that the place was very well-staffed and everyone who worked there seemed very informed about their section.The Dolphin Show was pretty cool. Also gets very crowded, so do show up early to your showing. Don't sit in the Splash Zone unless you're looking to take a bath.We also had tickets for the 4D show which nearly gave me a heart attack. I won't give it away here, but if you have back problems you might not want to take part in this.This Aquarium also has an indoor \"rain forest\" and a coral reef exhibit. While I have visited a couple of aquariums, I have never been to one where I was able to see live divers jumping into the tanks to feed and interact with the fish...So that was also a cool experience.Souvenirs are expensive just like everywhere else...This is a great trip to bring the kids along on. There are also a couple of other museums in the area (African-American History, Children's Museum)...so Baltimore definitely makes for an interesting trip." "1/29/2012"
"40" NA "I have come here with my family a few times now and this is a great aquarium. There's a lot to see and the layout is really neat. The prices are pretty steep in my opinion ($30 for adults and $21 for children 3 and above), but we like to take advantage of the Friday after 5 pm deal where it's only $12 (for kids & adults). I would recommend buying tickets online. It'll save you from having to stand in line.Make sure you park in the Lockwood Place garage. You can get a discount by going to the aquarium's information desk and having them validate your parking ticket. Also, a tip if you have children: they do not allow strollers (because of the escalators and moving walkways). However, they'll store it for you and provide you with a child carrier if you don't have one." "2/9/2013"
