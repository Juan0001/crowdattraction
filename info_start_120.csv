"1" "4.0" "I loved the dolphin show! It reminded me of San Diego zoo.This aquarium isn't too big so you can see the whole place in a couple of hours.Tickets can be a little pricey, $30 per adult, and I think it's either $20 or $25 for children.But with parking (which is another $20) it's a pretty pricey visit so make sure you stay and look around and eat in Inner Harbor." "12/30/2012"
"2" "5.0" "We came here as a family for my daughters first birthday and we had a blast! For starters when we got to the ticket booth we found out they were having some sort of special they do like twice a year where everyone is only $12 to get in as opposed to the normal $35 for adults and $22 for children so from the beginning were extremely excited about that. When we got on they take a group picture at the entrance in from of a green screen for you to see later. Also they have a mandatory stroller check which I thought was a great idea to keep the congestion down. There were about four levels of awesome exhibits the reef at the bottom being one of my favorites. You get to see the sharks, sting rays, giant turtle, and some reef fish. Since the tickets were so cheap this day we decided to splurge a little and do the 4D movie polar express. I think that was actually my favorite part of our visit. Along with the 3D glasses, they made is snow, we were able to smell along with the movie, also the vibrations on our seats. It was super cool. My daughter, nephew, and the rest of us adults had a great time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I do think the regular pricing is a bit high personally... but definitely worth a visit!" "1/16/2015"
"3" "5.0" "I absolutely love this place! As much as I hate Baltimore, this is the best place along with the Inner Harbor and the World Trade Center next to it. I like the food there. I especially love the 4D movie clip there. The gift shop was nice. I love the top floor as well." "2/24/2015"
"4" "4.0" "Is there anything better than the National Aquarium? I think not! The new Black Coral Reef exhibit alone is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. To think that all the coral was hand-placed there to replicate the natural habitat of the fish and sharks, is unbelievable. And the huge whale skeleton hanging overhead? AMAZING!!! I definitely have to get back and spend a good day there exploring the other exhibits. There's just soooo much to take in and this one exhibit is just the tip of the iceberg. To think that we have a cultural facility like this one here in Baltimore blows the mind. EVERYONE should be taking advantage of the fact that this place is in our own backyard. We are truly fortunate." "10/9/2013"
"5" "4.0" "Had a great time and saw some amazing creatures. They currently have an Australia exhibit, a jellies exhibit and a rainforest exhibit, so you'll see more than just the usual aquarium creatures you'd expect. (Even some monkey-things and puffins, yay!)It's a bit pricey (about $30 a person), but it's a good two hours of touring, even more if you stay for one of the dolphin shows. Get there when they open to avoid the crowds and most of the whiny kids." "4/14/2013"
"6" "2.0" "This is a great aquarium, not complaints at all. I easily spent three hours here looking at their impressive collection of tropical fish, the refreshing rainforest room with birds flying about, and the dolphin show. The aquarium is positioned right on the Inner Harbor so it has breathtaking views with large windows at various points within the structure. What I liked most of all about this aquarium was how easy it was to follow the designed tour path. Everything was very well laid out and even though I didn't pick up a map but preferred to wander about I naturally followed the course of things. The design of the aquarium was fun just in itself. When you first walk in you are greeted by a huge waterfall flowing into a tank of fish..i forget what type- i saw a lot of fish today. As you start getting into the exhibits you are made to feel as if you are descending into a submarine and looking out of windows at fish around you. I thought this was really neat for the kids. As you leave this area you come out into the rainforest section which has tropical humidity, birds flying overhead and plants and water landscaping, the shark tank was also designed well and made you feel as if you were being \"circled\" by a group of intimidating sharks...many with messed up teeth I might add! The animals all seemed to be housed well and appeared to be well taken care of. I didn't see any that appeared to be sick or were far too big for their confined area...except for the octopus..common could we not get that guy a bigger tank? He barely had room to stretch his poor little tentacles. He was the only one i felt bad for, the rest pretty much looked as if they were living in animal planet's version of the MTV show Cribs.While its pricey to visit it is downtown Baltimore so I wasn't too surprised at the price. 30.00 was worth it to me for three hours. I also parked a couple blocks away for 10.00 for the day." "1/19/2013"
"7" "4.0" "Wish I could give more stars to this place. And, by the same token, I wish it was a better aquarium. Daughter is frustrated by the crowds making it hard to see in the tanks. Not a lot for kids to do except look. (Unlike Md. Science Center, which has lots of hands-on stuff.) VERY expensive admission. Separate charge for the dolphin show...which somehow manages to be not very interesting -- how do you manage that with dolphins?Also, not super happy about its stewardship of the National Aquarium in DC. During the Baltimore organization's tenure, it jacked up the price five-fold, cut hours and eventually went out of business. (Blaming it on the building renovation, but it's hard to believe a facility that cared about its DC presence couldn't have found an alternate location. Heck, National Harbor probably would have given them an entire street.)" "7/12/2014"
"8" "4.0" "$35 seemed expensive for an aquarium but it was quite a large aquarium. Definitely got my money's worth here. There's a dolphin show that lasts about 10-15 minutes where the trainers show off the dolphins. There's a 4D show that costs an extra $5. Not worth it. It was only a 10 minute clip. The actual clip is decent but the 4D effects are unnecessary and frankly.. distracting. Watched the Salmon Run which just had a ton of bubbles come up or large chilling gusts of wind." "10/5/2013"
"9" "4.0" "Our daughter loves it there! The membership is so worth it, as we can walk there whenever we want. I wish they expand it a bit though.. and make a bit bigger and diverse... it would've been nice to have penguins.." "3/12/2015"
"10" "4.0" "I enjoyed coming here. We walked around the Inner Harbor and made our way over. I took a lot of great pictures! The different exhibits from different parts of the world added to making it better. I enjoyed the rain forest. My husband loved the sharks!  The thing that disappointed me was, the dolphins venue. It opened at 10:30 and we went in and sat. All the did was give them balls and they swam around. We asked if a show was starting, because we wanted to get something to eat before we headed over to the Lacrosse Championship. They said they didn't know when one would start. So we got up and left. Everything else was cool though" "5/27/2014"
"11" "4.0" "This place was very good. I took my girl there as a date for spring break. This was our first time going there and we drove from far away. We loved to see the fishes and we took a lot of pictures and we had a good time. It brought us closer and the smiles on our faces are so rememberable. There was a lot of groups there but for the most part we got our time to see and explore the exhibits. Last the 4-D experience is worth the wait. We both loved the experience. It was a little crowed but we still enjoyed ourselves and had a good time." "4/16/2014"
"12" "4.0" "This is a great time! Fun for the whole family.  The new coral reef exhibit is great. It's full of colorful and exciting fish and sharks. There are also some great views of the harbor from the upper levels. I think they need to do a little better fundraising, $35 entrance is pretty steep." "6/28/2014"
"13" "3.0" "I'm reviewing this with the caveat that I was expecting a huge crowd (I went during their Fridays After Five discount, which is basically couples night) and that I haven't been to a dedicated aquarium that wasn't in a zoo before, but I definitely enjoyed it. The exhibits were pretty varied and, as a lot of them are multi-level, they have a lot of vantage points for viewing. A lot of captive animals / animals on exhibit make me feel uncomfortable (which I kind of felt about the dolphin show here, no Blackfish-level stuff, and I hear they may close that part of the aquarium) but everything seemed well-cared for and the staff were pretty engaged. Great for kids, but definitely pretty cool for adults too." "11/12/2014"
"14" "3.0" "$35 for admission is too much for this place. Lots of sea creatures to see; the main floor has the best display of rays, sharks, etc.  The dolphin tank was underwhelming due to the dolphins swimming underwater and not doing anybtype of exhibition you see at other places. However, you can go to a floor below to see the dolphins underwater through a glass wall, which is pretty cool.Droves of kids, and large extended families including adults makes seeing the smaller tanks very difficult.  Not the best layout either for navigating." "7/13/2014"
"15" "3.0" "My husband and I took our children down to the Aquarium for the first time for them. And honestly we were a little disappointed. The first mistake I think we made was going on a Friday around 4:00pm. We felt like we were rushed through the entire thing. Then we went to look for a snack or place to eat inside. Everything we found was closed! So we rushed also because we were getting hungry. The sharks were awesome though but it just didn't seem to really be worth all the trouble parking down town. I was a little disappointed when we left. I tried to make the best out of it for my daughters but it wasn't that exciting for her because the crowd was pushing her out the way where she couldnt see the exhibts." "5/17/2014"
"16" "2.0" "A nice place to spend a few hours while visiting the Inner Harbor. This aquarium is on the smaller side compared to other aquariums I've visited.The price of admission is high. If you are staying in a hotel nearby, I would definitely ask the front desk if they offer discount tickets. We were staying at the Hotel Monaco and they had tickets for $10 off!I enjoyed the multi-level Atlantic Coral Reef and Shark Alley tanks.  Don't miss the Jellyfish exhibit! I was disappointed by the Dolphin Discovery \"show.\" It was more of an educational thing aimed at a younger audience than a traditional dolphin show. I guess I expected more jumps and tricks, like they do at the Shedd.Oh, and make sure you grab a map. It'll help you navigate through the three buildings and connecting walkways." "8/27/2013"
"17" "4.0" "So I've been to many aquariums in my day, and I had high hopes for a place called \"National\" aquarium. My husband and I came here on MLK day, with loads of school-aged kids. I had a big pit in my stomach once I saw how much the tickets were, and I honestly feel like I should have turned around and not gone at that point.Nevertheless, we were there and decided to kill some time before heading back home after a fun weekend in Baltimore. Without nitpicking each exhibit, I would say that the entire place is somewhat of a let-down if you've been to other large aquariums. Many of the smaller fish exhibits are the same things that you've seen at many of the other aquariums, and similarly,  you will find a couple jelly fish tubes/tanks as well as a horseshoe crab pet tank. But nothing to knock your socks off - if anything, it upset me to find so many large fish in such small tanks. I'm not a PETA member, but it was obvious that some of the larger fish really needed some more space to really thrive. There was an interesting, but odd and out of place rainforest-type exhibit that really didn't seem to fit in the building to me. The one thing that I'm sure most people come to this place for (and I'm sure is why the ticket is so much) is the dolphin show. But if you've been to Sea World or honestly any halfway-decent sized aquarium that has dolphins, you've seen the tricks before. Again, I'm no PETA member, but I'm not a fan of dolphins in an aquarium for entertainment. It would have been nice to see the trainers use that opportunity to educate about conservation, but no such luck.All in all, I was pretty disappointed. Other cities have much better aquariums on either coast." "7/20/2013"
"18" "4.0" "Love this aquarium! It's very pricey ($35 per person) but if you are going to spend 3 hours there (which is easy to do) it's definitely worth it. The 4D theater is worth the extra cost as well. The only thing I'm upset about it that they took away the dolphin show. The dolphins are still there to see but they no longer do the choreographed event. I hear they now only do private encounters. Still worth a visit when in Baltimore." "7/13/2014"
"19" "3.0" "If you intend to go more than once than it is worthwhile to purchase a membership while you're there.  The aquarium is one of the nicer ones we've been to with plenty to see.  The reef tank is pretty amazing as are the rest of the exhibits.  The location is awesome as there are tons of restaurants and things to do nearby." "1/19/2015"
"20" "3.0" "We went with extended family so we had every age from a 4 year old to an 80 year old and I think all of us were less than wowed.  A really lovely and well set up building with great views of the harbor didn't make up for the fact that most of the exhibits were sort of...whatever.The dolphin show was cute but really disappointingly short - I think it lasted all of 10 minutes.  But prior to the show they allowed the kids to go and ask the trainers questions about dolphins which was a plus.   All of the staff we encountered was wonderful, kind and helpful.  Also - my mother has mobility issues and I have to say they could not have been more accommodating. We were allowed to enter through the members entrance and didn't have to wait for the timed tickets; we entered right away.In spite of the nice building, nice staff and scenic views it was still just an okay sort of day - except for the too brief dolphin show and the jellyfish exhibit I was mostly bored." "7/9/2013"
"21" "4.0" "Take note that although this aquarium advertises a military discount, they do not honor that discount at the window. You have to get tickets through your local MWR in advance... So, if you decide to go to the aquarium on a whim, prepare to pay full price. As for the actual aquarium itself...the experience itself was mediocre at best. Mobs of kids running around, screaming, stepping on your feet is one thing - and to be expected - but the place was littered with adults doing the same thing in the hot, cramped exhibit areas. The floor were also sticky-dirty like a movie theater. \"Meh\" at best." "10/19/2014"
"22" "4.0" "My, my, has the National Aquarium changed over the years!!I would kind of just like to copy and paste everything MacRae O. said in her review... because even three years later, the same still stands true.Price right now is $25, which seems pretty reasonable... except there is no student discount, and you have to jump through hoops just to get the military discount.  There is a lot to see, IF you can get up close to see it.  Lots of kids pressing their dirty faces against the glass.The dolphin show was kinda fun, but underwhelming when you compare it to someplace like Sea World.  The dolphins jumped like, twice.  It was more educational and who wants that?! Ok, I'm kidding, geez.  Best part in my opinion was the jelly fish area.  Don't miss that!  It's over by the dolphin show.Oh and you can't miss the gift shop, because there are like 10 of them." "6/26/2013"
"23" "4.0" "This place is huge!!! Actually the layout is pretty bad because we got lost a few times trying to figure out where we were supposed to be going. We started off with the dolphin show, which was amazing! We then were able to see the jellyfish exhibit. It was lackluster and not a lot of info about it. The def need to do some upgrading in that area. Next we found where we were supposed to be, the main attraction I assume. They have created somewhat of a reef with stingrays and fish in the middle and then escalators take you up to the different levels where you can learn about all the fish and aquatic animals. I liked all the information on the walls and there are volunteers or workers sporadic throughout the aquarium who are very knowledgable. On the top level, there is a open rainforest with birds flying free. Once you're done with the top level, you then start walking down where they have huge shark tanks. Not only do they have aquatic life, but they have lizards and such as well. I haven't been to very many amazing aquariums, but my husband said this one was ok. Most annoying part...they have a military discount but you have to purchase those tickets off site! They also have a discount if you're from MD. I was glad we came here while in Baltimore!" "11/4/2013"
"24" "4.0" "I always have a great time when I come to the Baltimore national Aquarium. It is beautiful on the inside and kids love it! So many different variety of fish and different sea creatures. One of my favorite things about it is the dolphin show of course. They even let kids come down to interact with the dolphin which is great.One thing I don't like about it is the price! When i went I think it was $35.00 a piece for everyone, which is too high! but other than the price, this place is great!" "6/22/2014"
"25" "4.0" "I have been here a few times over the years and most recently visited on Memorial Day this past weekend. This was my first visit to the aquarium as a parent. My daughter is a year old and we walked from the parking garage with our daughter in her stroller. Once inside (had corporate passes from work, so didn't pay for our tickets) we learned that strollers are not allowed to be taken into the aquarium. They have a free stroller check in (with about 50 strollers I could see already checked!) and will even give you a backpack carrier to put your child in so you don't have to carry your baby. We passed on that because it looked pretty ancient and uncomfortable. So between my husband and I we carried our daughter throughout most of the aquarium and let her walk in the places when it wasn't too crowded - which was few and far between. We went through the aquarium pretty quickly and wanted to watch the dolphin show, but the times were not posted anywhere for that. (You need to look them up online, which is not really convenient when you are there, standing in front of the entrance for the dolphin arena. I know, I know, everyone has smart phones, but still...) The best parts are the jellyfish exhibit, the shark tank and rain forest. However, carrying a toddler up and down the stairs so you don't slow down traffic in the humidity of the rain forest will get you SWEATY. Luckily my husband carried our daughter throughout most of our time in the aquarium. We saw a kid zone area, but it was incredibly tiny and disappointing. The sting ray exhibit was being renovated, so that was a bummer because that part is pretty cool.There is a food court and several snack kiosks throughout the aquarium, but they are pretty pricey. I suggest packing a few snacks and bringing them with you. Since I received the corporate passes for the aquarium from my work, we didn't have to pay admission or wait in the regular admission line. However, if we would have had to pay for our tickets, then I would only rate the aquarium with a three star review. Adult (ages 12-64) tickets are $34.95, children 3-11 are $21.95, seniors (65+) are $29.95 and children under 3 are free. I feel like those prices are too high for what you get. We were only there for two hours and I definitely would have been mad if we would have paid $70 (and parking!) for that. However, since the only thing we paid for that day was parking, I will let the aquarium slide with a 4 star review." "5/30/2013"
"26" "4.0" "The aquarium is an awesome place to take out of towners. My only gripe is the cost. It seems to have gone up a lot in the past couple years. My favorite parts are the jellyfish exhibit, the dolphins, and last but not least Calypso (its the aquariums 500+ pound green sea turtle). Its awesome standing above that massive turtle swimming in the Blacktip Reef." "6/10/2014"
"27" "2.0" "Had not been here in YEARS and recently decided to bring the kids on a hot Monday morning. We were here for hours. The aquarium has underwent some minor renovations since I was last here. They have jelly fish, coral reefs, dolphins, sharks and an Australian rainforest. They also now have a 4D theater that plays two different short 15 minute films. We saw Happy Feet, the kids loved it. When we flew, we felt the actual air. When it snowed, we were snowed on. When it rained, we got sprayed with water. When they danced, we felt the vibration in our seats. It was fun even for the adults! They feature two different films at a time, you have to purchase the tickets separately for $5. I was disappointed to see they no longer had whales which I know they had when I was a kid. Bummer. Otherwise, it was fun and a lot smaller than I remember it to be. But we were literally there all day, from 9 AM - 3:00 PM so we definitely had enough to see and do. The kids loved it, and we picked to go early as possible on a Monday so that it wouldn't be as crowded as a weekend afternoon. Last, we saw the dolphin training show before we left for the day and the sap I am teared at how cute and sweet the dolphins were. The kids loved it and it was educational. I think the aquarium is always a great place to take kids, or if you just want a little marine in your life. I still believe that this is one of the best, I've been to ever." "6/26/2013"
"28" "3.0" "Okay so my wife and I came here this past weekend. I don't know why I keep coming to this aquarium. it really isn't that good. I've been to the Georgia Aquarium 2 times and it is MUCH better/bigger.okay since my last review, it looks like the prices are now much more expensive.. i think it is now about $35 a person.. and there is NO dolphin show. so higher ticket prices, no dolphin show. when we went on Sunday morning, the dolphins were just swimming around. They do have a jellyfish room now (maybe they read my previous review).i didn't see any tanks to pet stingrays/horseshoe crabs. maybe i missed it. my wife and i read most of the signs and saw every tank. took us no more than 2 hours. For $70 for 2 people (and then adding in another $20 or so for parking), this place is not worth it. We did go to a great restaurant afterwards (Mama's on the Half Shell). See my review for that. We should have just went to the restaurant and not the aquarium. I feel like I was ripped off $100." "8/27/2013"
"29" "3.0" "Oh how long it's been since I've set foot in the world of childish wonder that is an aquarium. Nowadays, the experience isn't complete with echoes of \"Nemo! Where's Nemo!?\"The Baltimore aquarium has a nice selection of exhibits ranging from desert habitats to Maryland waters to the rainforest and beyond. We went on a Saturday afternoon- go earlier when it opens or you'll hit the midday crowds. To give you an idea of just how much there is to see, we strolled through most of the exhibits before realizing that our feet were starting to complain and that three hours had passed! My favorite exhibit by far is the jellies. There's just nothing cooler than floating glowing jellies to captivate the eyes.Overall, the aquarium was entertaining and educational. However I felt like it was in dire need of an update. Something to spice up the presentation of the exhibits, something to bring it into this century. This aquarium is well renowned and I was just expecting more than I got. The displays were all no brainers, rectangular windows along the concrete walls. Many of the windows were dirty and got in the way of the experience. To maximize the effect of the cool animals and sea creatures, I'd appreciate some re-engineering of the architecture and some more high tech interactions for the fun facts." "2/2/2014"
"30" "4.0" "Meh.  I found it hard to navigate.  Also, I'm from Boston and spoiled by the New England Aquarium.  The dolphin tank was cool, but without set show times it's hard to be there when there is something going on.  I was there during a lull, although the seats were wet, so maybe is just missed the excitement." "11/30/2014"
"31" "4.0" "Other than the fact that we went on a Saturday morning and it was already swarming with rugrats, we really enjoyed it.  It is a tad expensive but we saw numerous folks who brought their lunch in and were enjoying it in the cafeteria.I must say the Jelly Fish exhibit was the best!I wish they would offer and Adults Only event....it would be a little quieter, but we really did like it!" "7/29/2013"
"32" "4.0" "Pretty big aquarium!The thing that attracted us to go were the dolphins.  We chose a seat and waited.  The trainers then went on the microphone to say that this was an open thing and there weren't any shows scheduled.  It's more of a tune in to see what the dolphins are doing and watch them feed the dolphins.  No Sea World tricks here.  Would have to take a star off for that.Otherwise, the aquarium is extensive.  There is an outdoor habitat where you can look at birds.  Watch out for pooping birds!  Also an area to view Australian-themed animals?  Not sure.  Didn't complete that.Lots of fish and the sark area was pretty cool.Pricey at about $35 for adults.  Another $5 if you want to do the 4D thing.  We skipped on that.There's a cafeteria there that servers child-friendly stuff with pizza, hot dogs, chips, etc.  I say you save lunch for a restaurant in the harbor area." "4/26/2014"
"33" "4.0" "Okay so this is definitely one of the better aquariums in the United States. However, it is pretty expensive to get in. Adult admission is $34.95 which is pretty steep considering the Georgia Aquarium (the largest aquarium in the world) is $31.95 to get in last I checked. With that being said, I do feel this is one of those must see things while visiting Baltimore. The aquarium is very nice and well set up. The staff members here are really friendly, engaging, and informative. They have quite a few things to see including a well done Rainforest exhibit and several really large tanks. This aquarium is pretty big so be sure to grab a map to make sure you don't miss any areas. If you take your time and see everything it will probably take you about three hours to go through the whole thing. Be aware they no longer do animal shows here as others have said because they feel it is noneducational. I would recommend getting your tickets ahead of time because the ticket lines can be pretty unpredictable. Another tip, if you get tired and want to take a quick rest they have a seating area overlooking the inner harbor with great views." "9/29/2014"
"34" "3.0" "This place was HUGE and so much fun. My husband and I went on a Friday at 4:30pm and it wasn't busy at all. Being that it's just him and I we did some research on the place and found the best time to go which just happens to be when a bunch of kids on school field trips were done touring the place! We aren't anti-children but we wanted to be able to enjoy ourselves and as we were coming in we did see some rowdy and obnoxious school groups leaving so we're glad we picked that time. The best things about the aquarium are the variety of fish, jellyfish room, and the dolphin show!" "6/2/2013"
"35" "4.0" "The amount of germs contained within this building is horrifying. I visited this aquarium on a Wednesday and had the worst cold of my life for the following 9 days. So many atrociously virus-laden children packed into the spiraling bowels of the place. Completely impossible to avoid them. Shudder.But there were some great things to look at here. Snaggletooth fish, derpy sharks, and happy dolphins. The stingray petting pool, a staple of any aquarium, was under construction. There was a projection on the floor attempting to make up for it. Fail.Pretty pricey, too, at like $29 a pop for adult admission. But there definitely are worse ways to spend 2-3 hours of your life." "5/8/2013"
"36" "5.0" "This is a wonderful aquarium. They have several floors of exhibits, with all kinds of animals, from fish to reptiles, to underwater mammals. The dolphin show, which is free with admission, is excellent. It is pretty pricey for admission, however. Check the website before you go for discount ticket offers. It can also get pretty crowded, especially on weekends, so try to go at an off-time if you're able. There's a ton to see, so it's definitely worth going more than once." "6/5/2013"
"37" "3.0" "This is the place to take visitors and to spend a day with the kids. I am not an 'aquarium' kind of person, but this place is just amazing. Visiting takes a little planning, but it is well worth it. You may think it is pricey, but balanced with all the conservation work they do, you can feel good about the dollars they spend. It's always great to learn something while you are having fun, and this is the perfect combination of both. Spend the extra money and see the dolphin show, don't stop going up until you hit the rain forest exhibit, and along the way see every type of aquatic habitat and fish, turtle, reptile, and even some cute puffins. Love this place!" "8/18/2013"
"38" "4.0" "I had family visiting and this being their third time in DC, we'd already done everything near me, so we decided to make a trip up to B'more.Everyone recommended the aquarium, but tickets were so pricey! The three of us plus parking would put us way over $100.So, we took advantage of the Friday after 5pm deal, where it's only $12 per person.We bought our tickets online ahead of time, but still had to wait in line to pick them up when we got there, so didn't really see the point in that, especially since there was a $2 per ticket surcharge.Not sure if it was the weather (rainy day) or if it's typical for a Friday evening, but once we got our tickets, there was no line getting in.They even let us in early at 5ish, even though our tickets were for a 5:15 entry.We loved the sharks (always our favorite), and the dolphins and puffins were adorable! The view of the harbor was nice too. While the place started getting a bit crowded around 6 (I guess most people were coming after work), it wasn't packed at all. We were able to see all the exhibits without having to push through people or being rushed. Compared to the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, it does look a bit worn down and outdated, but in this area, it's well worth a visit.  Definitely recommend the Friday after 5 deal! You can stay till 9:30, which leaves you ample time to check out the aquarium without the crowds. It took us about 3 hours to see everything including some time at the gift shop. They're opening a new reef exhibit this summer, so am looking forward to going back." "2/2/2013"
"39" "4.0" "MUST-SEE attraction if you visit the Inner Harbor. BUT, some tips to enjoy the experience;(1) Go off-peak times: my wife & I visited on a Wednesday In January when it was less crowded. (2) If you visit in the winter, use the lockers or coat check so you're not carrying everything with you. It can get warm in the rainforest exhibit.(3) if you don't like being around children, this place is not for you. (4) check the daily schedule for jellyfish or dolphins shows. It may be less crowded there in the AM then the aquarium exhibit side.We found the employees very helpful and informative. Enjoy." "1/31/2014"
"40" NA "There's many great aquariums around the world, but this is the \"National\" aquarium and located at the very scenic and fun Inner Harbor in Baltimore. There are some really great and large exhibits inside and it is a leader in the study, and teaching of aquatic, marine and mammal life. Being that I live in Baltimore and have been there many times, I've grown slightly bored of it, but when I've taken out of town friends and family there, they always had a great time. Admission has gotten a bit pricey over the years, and food inside is on the expensive side as well, but with so many dining choices just outside its doors, you don't need to eat inside if you don't want to. If you're looking to save a few bucks, look for Friday evening deals and some deals later in the evening time, a few hours before it closes. They offer significant discounts then. It is well worth a visit!" "8/1/2014"
