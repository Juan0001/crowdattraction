"5.0" "This aquarium is okay, not great. I have been to many, including Monterey Bay, Atlanta, & Shedd in Chicago: Baltimore's got nothing on those three.I normally wouldn't deduct stars for crowds at a zoo/aquarium, because let's be honest: you should expect crowds of screaming knee high kids, kids on field trips, kids in strollers, and tween kids that are bored & more interested in their smart phones and will bump into you. But I have to say, the crowds here were ridiculous. I would HIGHLY highly recommend coming BEFORE 11am or after 3pm, and whenever you come, BUY TICKETS IN ADVANCE! Can't stress this enough. The crowds were pretty awful, and the layout of the place (my next gripe) isn't crowd friendly for viewing exhibits.The layout: not a fan. The whole place is just sort of dark and grim, and I'd much prefer bright, cleanly lit viewing areas. The one highlight is walking around with the Caribbean reef surrounding you; that was legit. Other than that the crisscrossing weirdo escalators, labyrinth of ramps/stairs, etc were very overwhelming. Plus, there are SO MANY PICTURES ON THE WALLS. I'd much prefer to see space occupied by real-life plants + animals, and not a bunch of highly-saturated, so-bright-they-hurt-your-eyes blown up photos.Next complaint: the \"eco-propaganda\". The rainforest exhibit \"destruction ticker\" was so dismal, and provided virtually nothing to viewers besides facts about how much rainforest is being destroyed per minute. Yikes. It was sort of the same throughout the aquarium. Lots of \"Save Our Ocean/Save the Planet\" type things, which I never find very useful. I am an environmental science major with a particular interest in marine biology & conservation, and I tried talking with numerous guides/employees about the aquarium's conservations efforts to no avail. One employee told me that they don't provide straws or lids to the drinks in the cafe as part of their efforts. I was hoping to hear a little bit more about what they're doing in the field, and I think it's reasonable to expect an exhibit staff member to be able to provide some info along those lines. When someone behind me in the cafe asked why the bottled water was so expensive, the cashier said, \"It's going to a good cause.\" I'd sure like to know what cause that is.Cost: it is high. But expect that. You have to keep in mind how much it costs to maintain a place like that, and don't complain about food costs. Everyone should have learned by now to pack a lunch to some place like a zoo/aquarium, and to always sneak snacks into a movie theater. It's just common sense. Yeah, you're going to pay $7 for a tiny, bad sandwich. I can't deduct for that, but expect it. However, with the quality of the aquarium, I would have expected to pay $18-22 TOPS, not $29. I was a bit put off by that. Included a dolphin show that only goes twice a day, so I didn't see it.The animals: I've seen better, but they do have some cool animals. The sand-tiger sharks are awesome, the rays are great, and there's a nice variety of species. I guess my biggest complaint about this place is that everything is just dark & dated, and the employees don't seem too interested in marine conservation or the mission of the place itself. I would never come close to rating this as the \"Best in the Nation\" and would expect more from our National Aquarium. I'm glad I went because I love staring at fish for hours, but if it hadn't been for my appreciation of the animals, I would have been disappointed.Bottom Line: take your kids, they'll like it. If you're an adult visiting by yourself, bring some head phones & an iPod to drown out screaming children, people calling rays flounders, children counting how many Nemos & Dorys are in that one exhibit, etc. It's more enjoyable to your own soundtrack."

"3.0" "This is such an AMAZING place.   LOVED LOVED LOVED.  File this one as a cool first-date spot. The Aquarium's design is really neat as you feel like walking through a massive, vertically positioned fish tank. So even in summer's heat, you are enjoying the site in air-conditioned comfort; this isn't always the standard, ie. Miami.   There are various levels, with exhibits in each floor ranging from stingray's to sharks to toads and other critters.  There is a Rainforest area with lots of plants to admire for city dwellers.We paid $29 bucks for admission to 3 exhibits: aquarium, a 25-min dolphin show (housed in another tank connected to main building) and 25-min 4D screening. To avoid the crowds, buy your tickets in advance with late afternoon admission (our queu was @ 3:30).  We killed time having lunch at nearby McCormick & Schmicks. We felt a bit rushed in between the exhibits/shows, but even so we had ample time to take pics in front of the great whites.  If I had to do it again, I'd skip the 4D show to spend more time in the aquarium. It was a busy summer day and there were LOTS of kids and many cranky parents (strollers must be checked in upon entrance) ...but as the day winded down (4sh), the crowds dropped dramatically. By 5 pm, we walked leisurely without worry." "9/18/2008"
"4.0" "I went this past Mother's Day weekend with my husband and son, and we enjoyed watching our little boy look around in fascination.The good: great for kids, lots of things for them to look at, the exhibits are nice, depending when you go you can catch some tanks for feeding time, they have a sea turtle (\"Calypso\" I believe they call it-- missing front flipper)The bad: Parents with younger kids- you aren't able to bring your strollers in. You have to check it before you are able to continue through the Aquarium. I found this to be pretty annoying since my son isn't able to walk yet. (they will lend you a \"back pack\" for your child.), More importantly: The dolphins, sharks, other sea life... it is quite unfair to have them all in captivity. I understand that there will always be aquariums, zoo's, etc, but the impact it has on the animals long term is pretty horrible." "5/11/2011"
"3.0" "I finally got to come here.  I purchased tickets online which I redeemed at the Will Call windows and avoided the long lines.  This is a really nice aquarium and is built upwards due to limited space.  It was quite busy when we arrived and they try to  limit the crowd by assigning tickets with different entrance times.Strollers aren't allowed in this aquarium because of the crowds and sometimes narrow passageways.I really enjoyed the giant sea turtle in the stingray pool, it only had 3 fins cuz he lost one.  The shark pool is also pretty cool too.  I would come again if I have the time.  Be prepared to spend at least 3.5 - 4 hours here because of the crowds, everything moves real slow." "7/27/2009"
"2.0" "Very nice aquarium but way too crowded.  Had to fight insane crowds to see anything.  They should restrict how many people can be in the aquarium at once much more than they do.  This aquarium is very old school and dark, with only the Australian exhibit being more open and modern.  The penguin exhibit is also very small and it bothered me that they had such a small space." "7/17/2011"
"3.0" "My bad review is based on the prices going up so much, the rude employees and the crazy entrance time schedule this Aquarium keeps.  I tried to go on a nice Saturday afternoon around 2pm...BAD IDEA! I haven't been to this Aquarium in about 5 years and I was shocked when I saw how much the ticket prices had gone up.  Admission used to be $18-20 which included access to everything (Aquarium,Dolphin show, 4D theatre).  I was pretty shocked to see that it is now $29 to and that they are charging 5$ extra to see the dolphin show.   There was chaos at the ticket booth line with people just standing around confused on which line to get in because the Aquarium employees were shouting that the aquarium's next entrance time was not available until 5pm. The Aquarium closes at 6 which means I would have had to pay $30 to rush through the museum and see the dolphin show.  Oh but wait after I stood in line to purchase tickets I was informed that the dolphin show was sold out.   The employees were very rude and did not seem happy about having to answer questions about entrance times or anything else for that matter.  ******HINT: Buy tickets online a few days before so you not only are guaranteed a ticket into the aquarium but so you can also get the time you want*****I will be back at some point because whats IN the aquarium is pretty cool and definitely worth seeing if you are in town. The aquarium ticket office needs to brush up on their customer service and people skills or you are going to have people get out of line like I did.  But take my advice to buy tickets ahead of time online , and/or look for coupons or promotions for discounted tickets." "4/9/2012"
"4.0" "I visited the National Aquarium on a Sunday afternoon. The place was crowded. Really crowded. Tons of little people that are only knee-high yelling and screaming and crying. Birth control at its finest. However, in light of that, the Aquarium is a really fun place to kill a few hours. The exhibits were great. My favorite part was the Rainforest.  Admission was $25 no student discount.My recommendation to the Aquarium- there should be an adult only time where drinks are served!" "2/26/2012"
"5.0" "Nice... Ive seen better." "8/26/2012"
"4.0" "I couldn't ask for more when visiting an aquarium.  The place is huge and has a wide array of exhibits featuring a dizzying number of animals from all over the world.I highly recommend a visit to this aquarium when in Baltimore; it's up there with Boston as one of the best." "1/31/2011"
"4.0" "Ordered tickets online around midnight the night before (use their website and not Ticketmaster to avoid the convenience fee) for general admission plus the dolphin show.  You can conveniently use the credit card you order with to print your tickets at an automated machine (reminiscent of an ATM) behind the ticket purchase counter next to will call.There are several parking decks in the area but we preferred the deck on the right one block past the aquarium.  Once you park go directly across the street for a nice treat at Miss Shirley's before you begin your Aquarium adventure!Our tickets were for 11am but we were allowed to enter at 10:30.  The dolphin show began at 11:30 and was very interesting.  The show was informative and entertaining focusing on conservation and the similarities between dolphins and humans.We spent the next 3 hours exploring the various areas of the aquarium.  The jellyfish exhibit was awesome.  I never realized there were so many different types of jellyfish.I found all of the exhibits to be interesting but agree with other reviews that some of the tanks seemed much smaller and more cramped than they should be.  The electric eel and octopus seemed to have barely enough space to move around.Recommend for an entertaining and informative afternoon (both solo or with the family)." "8/2/2010"
"5.0" "It's been quite a few years since I've visited the Aquarium. Since my Canadian wife has always wanted to go, this week was as good as any. I like how they have completely redone the entrance with the addition of the waterfall and Australian looking rock formations.  They've added lockers, bathrooms, a photo kiosk, and a cafe. Then you go upstairs and still, with all the new stuff, they kept the bubble tubes. I remember long ago when the entrance was up an escalator they were the first sight you saw and heard on your way into the aquarium.  There were many children, but what do you expect on a Saturday. Even with the shrieks and wails we still enjoyed going through the various exhibits and ending up in the Jellyfish room. It was a great time, just expensive to do often. Sadly, we didn't get to see the dolphin show or any of the films, that will have ti wait for another visit." "1/24/2011"
"4.0" "second biggest aquarium in the country? three floors of fish! different types of fish galore! definitely on the pricey side, $30 to get in and $5 for the 4D movies (happy feet (15minutes long) or alaskan bear experience) but id say its worth it to go at least once.  ranges from dolphin shows to jelly fish to sharks to australian exhibit to frogs to a rainforest etc.  so much to see.  definitely can see it in one day though.  good part is there are lockers on the first floor which are $3.  favorite part was probably all the poisonous frogs.  so small and yet so deadly.  can you train a shark? you can train dolphins and killer whales.  next stop will be atlanta for the biggest in the country! fish are boring, they just swim in circles all day long.  the food is what you expect, salad burger pizza chicken fingers.  all you gotta do is get a hand stamp and eat at chipotle right next door!  or dicks last resort.  plenty of options." "5/4/2013"
"4.0" "Visited while in town visting. The outside of the building is very pretty and surrounding area looks new and fun. The aquarium easily keeps you entertained for ~3 hours, which is actually bettter than I can say for a lot of aquariums.DO.NOT.GO on a Saturday! I didn't try on a week day but I would assume it's way less of a nightmare. You cannot get near any exhibits or tanks, and parents with children will literally hit and shove you out of the way to let their kid be front and center. The glass could stand to be cleaned, on a lot of exhibits.The dolphin show is really nothing special. I am assuming maybe throughout the day the dolphins shows differ, but the one I saw was lame to say the least. It's just a bunch of dolphin facts thrown at you and a few splashes, not really great." "9/28/2011"
"5.0" "A great place to take the kids, however, the admission price is way too high at $34.95 for adults.  There are no coupons available anywhere, unlike other venues.  the tour cost me $70 bucks for me and my daughter......I will not be back with so many other wonderful things to do in Baltimore." "6/14/2013"
"5.0" "There is nothing to add that the other reviewers haven't already said. This place is ginornous, and beautiful. The amount of different species is astounding. There were very few empty exhibits. The rain forest room I could have hung out in for days. The 4D experience was awesome and the food court was delicious. We went on Halloween weekend so there were pumpkins hiding in many of the tanks and displays. It was so cute. My only complaint is that I am saddened by any dolphin show, there is way too much information out there about how inhumane they are for me to enjoy it." "11/28/2011"
"5.0" "This aquarium pretty much knocked my socks off in a lot of ways, most especially how incredibly - really, ridiculously - friendly the staff was.  We got welcomed by the security staff at the front, who remembered us from the morning and asked how we liked it when we left.  EVERY SINGLE staff member that we passed greeted us with a friendly smile and an attitude like they were happy to see us.  This is customer service WAY above the norm, and it definitely put us in a good mood.I loved that the aquarium is set up in a way where you get to see some of the bigger things from multiple angles - like the manta rays, and the sharks/Atlantic fish.  The rainforest room was very cool and interesting.  I didn't get a chance to look at all of the smaller tanks as much as I would normally have loved to, but got a glimpse of the flooded Amazon river and gawked at the enormous fish they have in there.I absolutely want to come back here and take a more extensive look at everything they have." "6/24/2011"
"4.0" "Robin and I headed up to Baltimore this past Friday.  It seems odd, but this is really only the second aquarium I'd ever been to in my life.  I have seen the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, but since we don't have one in Pittsburgh, I'd hadn't had much chance to go see one.  Well I must say that if I could only go to two, it might as well be two fine ones.  Robin was really smart in buying our tickets in advance.  This place can get awfully busy, particularly on a holiday weekend.  We saw some special exhibits.  \"Jellies Invasion:  Oceans out of Balance\" showed how the climate changes have resulted in their population being out of balance.  \"Animal Planet Australia: Wild Extremes\" highlighted Australia's aquatic animals.  LIke Kyle noted in his review below, you're right in the middle of a habitat among high rock cliffs, bats hanging from the ceiling, birds chirping.We also saw some of nature's nastier sea creatures such as the death adder, the Atlantic sea nettles, the electric eels, and poison dart frogs.  I was particularly fascinated by the \"Maryland:  Mountains to Sea\" (I have a penchant for local stuff) and \"Surviving Thru Adaptation\".This place is pretty pricey, but it's well worth it.  Get there early as Robin and I did and be sure to get prepaid tickets." "6/1/2010"
"2.0" "I'm a huge fan of aquariums, and of museums and general, and this is my third lengthy visit to this aquarium.The pricing is a bit much (it's about $22-24, even with a AAA discount], but I think the aquarium is very well run.Coming from the West Coast, I've seen a lot of good aquariums, and while this aquarium can't compare, it is easily one of the best ones to visit on the East Coast (don't even bother with the one in D.C.) The displays are well organized, with different levels with different exhibits, all surrounding a large pool with stingrays, sharks, turtles, and divers.  It's really quite a cool effect, especially since the lights are dimmed and set to a greenish-blue tone, with reflective surfaces on all the escalators.  One of the nice things was how progressive each of the \"stages\" or levels were - it started at a local level, but then progressed to more worldy places, before finally ending in the rainforest level.  There's also descending levels to the shark area, which was also one of my favorite parts of the museum.  There's then a long walkway to the jellyfish and dolphin portion of the museum.  The jellyfish exhibit was extremely cool, with many different species, and if there's no show, you're free to sit in the dolphin area to look at the trainers play with them.  My only complaint that it was not quite as \"wow!\" as I expected, though the displays were good (my favorites was the lower area for the sharks, and then the jellyfish).  However, even though my friends and I came around 10AM, it was extremely crowded, which made trying to see the smaller exhibits really hard.  While I usually stay 3+ hours in an aquarium, we had to go through this one fairly quickly (at least the smaller exhibits on the levels - we hung around the sharks for a while) since there were so many people shoving." "7/7/2011"
"4.0" "I went here with my family over the weekend. They do crowd control, but still let too many people in. When 1,000 little kids are all kissing the glass nobody can see anything. Next time I would show up on a weekday at the crack of dawn, so I actually could view the different aquariums. They need to have people walking around moving folks along. The temperature was awful. It was cold outside, yet it was hot as hell in there. I could not wait to get back into the cold weather. The biggest trap is the 4D show. It is only 15 MINUTES LONG and has commercials. Are you kidding? Everyone was pissed. The effects were cool, but the show should be at least 30-45 minutes. The actual planet earth movie is over an hour. This cost $5 a person. If you are with a large family DO NOT DO THIS, as it will be a waste of money. Real small children will also get scared of the special effects.  Their feature exhibit was jelly fish... Really? No one wants to see jelly fish. Next time I am hitting up the ZOO!!!!" "3/12/2012"
"4.0" "This is our national aquarium. Be sure to book tickets in advance and be early! The fish and frogs are terriffic and the australian exhibit has a lot to see -(but be patient) The Jelly fish will take your breath away. Take you time, there is a lot to see in this treasure." "4/21/2011"
"4.0" "The National Aquarium here in Baltimore is Amazing. It starts from as soon as you enter and goes like 4 floors below the sea level to all of these different exhibits. I'll say it even rivals that of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The architecture of the building outside and in is well thought up. But I think the best part of this aquarium is the dark portions of this place. The shark exhibit that they have is way sweet because when you walk through the museum you walk above it and across it, allowing you to look down at all of the sharks, turtles, and rays they have. The location is great, right in the harbor, so you can go here then get a bite to eat at the near by restaurants.And if you bring a camera, bring extra film or memory cards cause you'll be photographing everything!Enjoy." "2/6/2009"
"2.0" "Been coming here for years, and I have never, EVER been disappointed. That's really hard to say for any establishment.  The dolphin show is both hilarious and entertaining.   To some who don't like the show, do expect that its family entertainment, so it should be \"cheesy,\"  What do you expect?  A dolphin strip show? Laser beams?  Violence?  It's nice how they just fixed up the place.  Will be back!" "6/2/2012"
"4.0" "I like aquariums as much as the next gal, but they often blur together after a while. I mean, how different can tanks filled with water and fish be? We headed to the Baltimore Aquarium on a rainy weekday, so it was pretty slow. We went with my son, 18 months, and his cousin, a few months younger. We packed up our strollers with snacks and diapers and toys to keep them occupied and proceeded inside. We bought our tickets (which were crazy expensive for what we got) and headed to the coat-check. We immediately noticed the signs everywhere for \"no strollers in aquarium! Check strollers here!\" Thinking that couldn't possibly be their policy, we asked the coat-check people, and they coldly told us that no strollers were allowed in the aquarium, and that's just the way it was. We balked for a while, trying to process how we were going to carry our kids through the whole aquarium when they inevitably got tired and cranky and fussy. It really didn't help that the employees were totally rude and unsympathetic. The surly coat-check people offered us these giant, antiquated backpack/chair combos. We tried it for about 3 minutes and realized that our bad backs weren't going to be able take it. So we spent our time at the aquarium chasing after my son, and then carrying him when he got too tired. Not fun. Wouldn't it have been nice to have had a stroller to push him around? Alas.The aquarium itself was nice enough. It was clean and the multi-tiered main pool was interesting from many different perspectives. But the new outback part was pretty silly and, from what I've heard, was a pretty big chunk of change for little payoff. Too bad." "11/8/2010"
"4.0" "I've been a few times and I have to say its great. Who doesn't like to marvel at seahorses, jellyfish, sharks, sting rays... Incredible! My only gripe is that the escalator to the rainforest was broke down and the attendant just let everyone walk through the revolving door without any warning that there was no escalator service... Not good. Also, it's crowded and the kids go crazy, which is expected. So if you want a little peace, maybe go during the week when the kids are in school." "8/24/2012"
"4.0" "This Aquarium is pretty legit and I am very impressed. I came here last weekend with my parents and honey bun and we have a very good time. Unfortunately we were pressed for time so we only got to explore one section of the Aquarium which sucked but I would definitely recommend to people of all ages. The other cool thing that I liked was the on-site cafe eatery. They have fresh food, Chicago style pizza, Paninis and anything else you can think of. I don't remember the pricing because I didn't get anything except a bottle of water but you can tell they took the extra step. I will definitely come back to finish exploring the other parts we miss!!!" "8/3/2012"
"5.0" "Needs a little bit of updating, but it's a gem." "11/28/2012"
"5.0" "Definitely a must see.  I was anxiously awaiting the completion of the new addition, and now I love it even more.  This place is like the NYMET... you have to go at least once in your life.  I have been to many other aquariums, but I always have a really fun time here.  My only suggestion is to NOT ever visit on a weekend.  Obviously this is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the nation and you will regret it if you do.  Otherwise, there is a wonderful variety of displays and the setup is really great.  Please visit!"

"3.0" "My friend and I went in the morning of September weekday. We were able to spend enough time peacefully at each spot and volunteer staff were friendly and helpful." "9/23/2012"
"3.0" "Nice aquarium.  However, expensive for what you get.Seaworld a better value by far and much better.North Carolina aquarium in Manteo and Carolina beach nicer.They do have a dolphin show WhiCh I did not see but heard it was good.  Extra money to attend.Very dark inside and lots of kids running around all over the place.  If I went again it would be at a time when kids are in school so I could enjoy myself" "6/22/2011"
"3.0" "Food: TERRIBLE and overpriced.  Nearly everything is deep-fried; not a vegetable in sight (except french fries and sweet potato fries -- the latter are only available with the kids meal); small cup of yogurt that costs $1 at the grocery store costs nearly $3, and was not particularly cold; kids meal comes with soda -- if you want a small carton of milk isntead it'll cost you $2; you can't buy anything a la carte - have to get an $8 \"meal\" with fries, overly-sweetened applesauce, etc.; pizza looks to have been under heat lamps for hours (and this right at noon).  Terribly disappointing -- they've changed the menu in the past year or two -- last time we were here they had vegetable paninis and other, healthier options.  There are a lot of other choices right outside the aquarium -- choose them!Dolphin show: SO-SO -- a few dolphin tricks; mostly canned narrative and videos on big screens to the side of the pool.  Didn't hold my 2 1/2 year old's attention.  We got in free because we're members, but I don't know that we'll go again, even for free.Exhibits throughout the aquarium: WONDERFUL.  This is why we're members.  My son loves seeing the rays, turtles, sharks, fish, puffins & guillemots, etc.  Just loves the exhibits.  Being members means we can come and go as we please without worrying about the exorbitant entrance fee -- if it's too crowded we can just leave."

"3.0" "My bf is a big fan of aquarium, we both think that this is a nice aquarium, def. worth a trip if you are in town. This is def. one of the best aquariums we have ever been to, however, I am not sure if it is THE best, as it claim. We went there on a tue noon, and it was still very crowded. We have to wait every single time to get close to the glasses in order to see the fishes, which is kind of annoying after doing it for 20 times. They should also turn the ac up a lit bit, because I feel like some area of the aquarium doesnt have fresh air. We went to the one at Camden, NJ before, and we thought that one was really amazing as well. For $29/person, we feel like it is a lit bit expensive." "6/29/2012"
"4.0" "I was expecting so much more, I don't know why.  My BF enjoyed himself though.  I felt it was pretty redundant and was sad to find out there was no longer a famous dolphin show." "6/25/2012"
"1.0" "It's fun, bring your walking shoes (No strollers allowed -evil I know) and come early because this place gets packed! Follow the precharted course so you don't miss anything! See the mini Rain forest right in downtown Baltimore complete with wildlife roaming free (well, flying and crawling free in this limited space). A number of exotic birds, reptiles and arachnids. Parking is not available so the closest garage is Pier 5 or Best Buy. Do not bother trying to find street parking. Lots of restaurants in the Inner Harbor to fill your tummy before or after. I would not recommend the cafes here. The dolphin show is cute! I have been here at least four times and always see something new." "2/19/2010"
"5.0" "So I haven't been to very many aquariums but I have decided to try to see as many as I can.  A few weeks ago my fiance and I decided to go to the one in Camdem, NJ and least to say it was amazing. We had a great time but that's for another review.  After my experience at Camdem I thought to myself \"HECK YEAH!! IF THIS ONE IN JERSEY IS THIS GOOD THEN THE NATIONAL AQUARIUM AT BALTIMORE IS GOING TO BE 10 MILLION TIMES BETTER!!\"Sadly I was extremely disappointed and mistaken.Now I know my expectations were defiantly not high given I had read some of the other reviews below so I knew there were a few people with bad experiences when going to this aquarium but that did not hinder my motive to go.  Now most people are saying that it was very crowed and they had to wait for a long time to see the different exhibits but in my case that was not so.My fiance and I got there it was pretty empty but for the middle of the day on a Thursday it was quite a turnout. Firstly, I did not like the layout at all that was the first thing that really irked me. Second when it came to the rain forest I only thought it was cool because it actually simulated the environment of the rain forest but even that became quite annoying.  They keep a drizzle on so your basically coming out of this section rather damp (no homo) and a little sweaty.  Thirdly I personally felt that this aquarium was big for no reason...a whole lot of walking or maybe I'm just lazy =]By then end of the hour of walking around it left me wondering....where are all the sea animals at?" "9/17/2010"
"4.0" "When you first walk in, you are greeted my a tremendously tall waterfall that cascades right in front of you - a serious entrance and one that I wish I could replicate in my own house. Plenty to see here from sharks, dolphins, frogs, many types of fish, eels, and more! Noah's Ark probably had nothing on this place! The rainforest area was amazing. Felt very tropical and we even saw a lazy sloth resting in a tree. To top it all off, the cafe downstairs was recently redone and serves gourmet food; Yes we actually enjoyed our lunch. Gift shop is what you would expect - a way to to merchandise and profit from cute and cuddly sea creatures; But who could resist the Styrofoam shark with the light-up mouth that smiles wide every time you pull the fin....I know my four year old couldn't." "4/21/2012"
"2.0" "I love this place!In general, I like going to places with big and interesting exotic animals to see and learn about...this place is no exception!" "5/12/2010"
"3.0" "This aquarium is subpar.  First off, the place was poorly designed with  LOTS of bottlenecks.  For example, the escalators are only 1 person wide; automatic revolving doors allow only 1 person at a time; the informational boards (which separate each viewing window) jet out into the hallway, making the passageway only 1/2 width.  Causes huge backlogs of people who want to move thru certain exhibits faster, but can't.  Made the mistake of going on a Sat when the place was swarming with children.  The only part of the aquarium we enjoyed was the Australian exhibit (it was tucked away and few children found it).  Not worth the $30 admission for the \"total experience\" (dolphin show was predictable and we skipped the 4D movie since we disliked the place so much).If you're ever been to the Shedd in Chicago, then definitely skip this.  You will be underwhelmed." "1/2/2010"
"4.0" "The aquarium has raised their entrance fee (29$) and one floor is under construction. Basically, if you go now, you pay more and see less. The part under construction contained rays and turtles. Also, the dolphin exhibit is very short and not at all what it was three years ago, so if you saw it then, don't expect the same now. My advice, get a discount or call ahead to see what is operational." "3/25/2013"
"5.0" "Just became members and couldn't be happier!! Boyfriend and I went here on our anniversary as part of our day spent in Baltimore celebrating. We were able to see about half of the aquarium before having to head our to our next adventure, so we are definitely happy we got the membership. The day was nice but a field trip came in about halfway into our visit and those students were all sorts of horrible. They may as well as had no chaperons since the adults there did nothing to stop them from being so annoying. I feel so old saying that, but wow!! Also, parking prices were a little ridiculous, so that also helped knock down one star." "6/23/2012"
NA "Love, love, love it!!!  Best Aquarium I have ever been to.  It's great to have it so close to home.  Parking is kind of a bummer, especially if you aren't used to the city but it's worth the hassle!" "9/19/2013"
