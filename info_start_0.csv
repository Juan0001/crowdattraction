"2.0" "Came here last night with my family and got the 6:30pm entry time.  It's half off admission for everyone on Fridays after 5 which is awesome!went into the will call line because I wasn't able to print my tickets at home and I wasn't getting any signal on my phone to pull up the tickets through my email confirmation.  I told the guy and he said did you get the confirmation email with an attitude problem.. I said yes but there is no signal here so it's not loading!  Then he proceeded to tell me that it'll take a couple minutes to print out the tickets for me.. I said that's fine..  Went inside; got our picture taken - didn't get to see what our picture looked like because the line was so long and we didn't feel like waiting..  Went to the cafe and got a whole fresh pepperoni pizza which came with 4 drinks and 4 cookies for only $24.99(what a deal!) My kids really enjoyed their time here and we rushed to get to the dolphin show because the sign said their last showing was 8:30pm so we got there at 8 and just sat there and waited until we finally asked the worker and she said that they're done for the night since the dolphins are resting now... What a bummer." "8/22/2015"
"4.0" "I went on a Friday after 5 pm and received the half of price of 19$. I'm glad I didn't pay the full price. I understand the price is necessary to pay for the insane upkeep of the tanks, but as a visitor I got little value.  It was super crowded and so it was hard to even see the tanks or enjoy them. They need to put an occupancy cap or something, because I heard other people complaining about the crowd too. The amazon exhibit is laughable.  Just a bunch of trees. There is apparently some monkeys and birds, but I only saw one bird.  We walked the entire Aquarium and after we got to the last part, we were like, \"Is that it? DId we miss an exhibit?\"We saw the last 5 minutes of the Dolphin show, which I liked." "8/22/2015"
"5.0" "Stopped by to take our 2 year old toddler to check out the place.  He loves fish so we thought maybe he would love this place.  Been here once before, years ago, and I thought I remember it being pretty cool.So when you first buy tickets ($40/person...wow!!  Didn't realize how expensive this place was...good thing our kid was under 2 and free) they give you an entrance time.  I guess they want to space out the number of people in the place.  That's a good idea.  Except most of these people stay in the aquarium for hours on end, so there are still a ton of people inside.  It's set up pretty organized.  Good flow to the place.  But there are so many people staring into each aquarium that it took a while before you can squeeze in to take a look.  Especially difficult with a toddler who is anxious and fidgety to get in to see whats going on.  For the most part it was worth it, to see all the different animals and fish.  It was annoying when you wait a while, finally squeeze in to see the exhibit, and there's like 1 little frog, hiding under a leaf barely visible.  Lol.  Checked out the dolphin show.  Got there 30 minutes early and it was already filling up.  Pretty packed at showtime.  The show itself was a little disappointing though.  Very short.  I was expecting more tricks from the dolphins like jumping through hoops or something.  Toddler got antsy waiting around for so long that by the time the show started, he wasn't all that interested.  Plus, the whole aquarium being so dark in general made our kid tired.  Like it was nap time or something.All-in-all a great place, especially for kids, but for older kids.  Lots to see."

"4.0" "The best aqaurium I have ever been to. So took a trip here with my buddy and his family. Located in the inner harbour there is a lot to around this area. The location is great and just fun atmosphere.So on to the aqaurium it self. This thing is huge. It looks big on the outside, it's even bigger on the outside.There birds here too,  sharks, well hey its an aqaurium lol so all the aquatic life you can think of. They have dolphin shows, divers that go in with the sea turtles. I didnt see any go into the shark tank though :),which is good  . One of those 4d movies (was a blast). You get great views of the harbour. You could easily spend the whole day here. I was shocked this aqaurium seemed to have even more to see than the boston aqaurium.My favorite part of the aqaurium had to be the shark walk. You basically start at one level and walk your way around lower and lower. At each level you see different aquatic life it's set so the sharks and other fish are in their true as can be depth. The lower you go the darker it gets, and the more sharks you see.My pictures and videos dont do the aqaurium justice, definitely something you should experience for yourselves. That being said enjoy the pics and vids :)" "7/22/2015"
"4.0" "Need a place to get away from the day-to-day stressors of the world? Visit the National Aquarium and enter into the \"strange and wondrous world of water\". It's a family friendly, interactive educational experience. I always learn something random and exciting each time I visit. Although I tend to spend a lot of time in the colorful Blacktip Reef, Shark Alley, and Dolphin Discovery.   Did you know?-Two thirds of a shark's brain is dedicated to smell and they can live up to a month without eating-The first sand tiger shark pup to hatch in the womb will eat the other developing embryos-Female lobsters squirt their urine into a prospective male's den. That scent acts like a love potion which seduces the normally unfriendly male.This is a world class aquarium! I love this place. +: Embrace the Aquarium's entry scheduling system, it helps minimize overcrowding.++: People with special needs are welcome. Take advantage of express and early entry." "6/29/2015"
"5.0" "Lot and lot of fishyyyyy. I love how they design their coral reef tank. You're able to view from above, eye level and even beneath the tank. Kids will go crazy for this as there are multi level layers that goes around the aquarium." "9/18/2015"
"5.0" "This is a great aquarium to check out, located in the heart of the Inner Harbor.Many exhibits to visit and so much to learn and see.They are insanely pricey, but it's worth it if you are an animal lover.My favorite was the rainforest..hot, humid..loved it.." "5/28/2015"
"3.0" "This aquarium was beautiful! At first, my friends and I only visited the rain forest, dolphins, and jelly fish and we were like...that's it?! We don't need 3 hours in here. Well, we were wrong. We then proceeded to the main attraction. AMAZING! They have those flat escalators going at 30 degrees incline so you can see the tanks and the top of the tanks. There were tons of varieties of animals, particularly the fish and reptiles. It was very fascinating to see all the oddities and colors of animals that exist out there. I found Nemo!We stumbled on the dolphin show and it was fascinating. There were no long lineslike at Georgia Aquarium and there were plenty of seating. The dolphins were super cute and talented! Beware, you might get splashed.The jelly fish were fun to touch! You can only touch the top of them, but it's an interesting squishy feeling. They have sinks nearby to wash up afterwards, too.Definitely go to the rain forest first if you go towards the night because this aquarium runs on natural lighting so you can't see much if you're there too late. We only found a bird or two and a toad." "6/9/2015"
"5.0" "The National Aquarium in Baltimore's Inner Harbor is a fun place to visit, but it has lost some of its luster and is overpriced.Admission is now just a few cents shy of $40. Your AAA discount gets you $2 savings, but only if you buy tickets in advance from a AAA shop. $40 is a lot for an aquarium, especially when admission in 2011 was $25. Plus, you're on the hook for downtown parking which can be pricey.At $40 a ticket, I no longer feel that the facility can justify the cost. The entire aquarium feels dark and dated; parts are an 80s time warp. There hasn't been a major exhibit addition in years, and many of the placards are outdated (i.e. citing stats from the 90s). The dolphin show was canceled a few years back, no doubt due to pressure from the Blackfish crowd, and while there's still a keeper chat, this means that there's one less thing to do. Even on a busy Sunday, you can get through the entire aquarium in 60-80 minutes. That's a pricey hour.There are some really fun things to see here, like the shark tank and the puffins, but overall, I'd say that the admission value is relatively weak. Still, it's a good place to visit in Baltimore, but unless they add some new exhibits, I'd say that one visit per decade is sufficient." "7/12/2015"
"4.0" "I am absolutely fascinated by ocean life and marine biology. I usually visit the aquarium whenever I am in a different city. Baltimore's National Aquarium is, by far, the most impressive aquarium I've ever seen.  There are eight floors of exhibits! You could honestly spend a full day watching the animals. There is so much to see. I absolutely love the jellyfish exhibit. I didn't even know there were that many different types of jellyfish. They also had a very interesting section of colorful, tropical frogs. My favorite animal in the aquarium is the three-legged sea turtle. She is enormous. She is a rescue. The employees are very knowledgeable about the animals at the aquarium. They are happy to field questions. The habitats they have created for these creatures are absolutely beautiful. All habitants of the aquarium seem to be content and well taken care of." "5/4/2015"
"4.0" "After many visits to Baltimore, I finally got a chance to go to the aquarium.  The entire family had a great time.  There is a lot to look at.  But my favorite were the shark tanks." "8/30/2015"
"5.0" "One of the nicest aquariums I've been too! And Fridays after the 5pm it's half price so there's a bigger crowd so make sure to get in line early." "9/8/2015"
"4.0" "Went here for the first time on my anniversary and I couldn't be happier. Stayed for a few hours and as I was leaving I was messing around with the staff and said, \"aw man are we allowed to come back?\" Right away, they stamped my hand for re-entry. How amazing!!! $40 for a ticket with re-entry anytime?! Everything was beautiful. I was so amazed by everything! Especially the dolphin show! Cannot wait to come back again. The money was worth it. Best aquarium I've ever visited." "9/3/2015"
"5.0" "Initially my gf and I were very hesitant to go here because of the $35 price tag per person. But since we don't visit Baltimore often we decided to pull the trigger and purchased two tickets. It seems like they don't offer discounts, which kind of sucks but after experiencing it I understand why. If you enjoy the sea creatures living in our oceans then this place is a must go. There are a lot of fishes, turtles, sharks, puffers, dolphins and etc for you to see. This aquarium is HUGE, there are three major sections for your enjoyment. They also have a walkthrough rainforest which was really hot and humid. So if you visit during the winter like I did, you will be immediately taking off your layers because it is hot.. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, while I visited the Jellyfish exhibit was closed. I believe it will be closed until sometime in mid-Februrary. I got to experience the divers feeding the fishes and they were all very playful with the children observing them. Overall, I would recommend it and if you enjoy the animals living in the ocean then there should be no hesitation when it comes to purchasing your tickets. Worth it!" "1/26/2015"
"5.0" "Love the National Aquarium in Baltimore.  Was a member when they first opened in the early 1980's, and even though I\"m not a member now, we still go back and take relatives and friends to see the best and most extensive Aquarium around.  The Aquarium has expanded quite a bit since their original opening.  There is a lot to see and do.  Make sure to allow enough time both because of the extensive exhibits, but also because of the crowds.  Going early morning or very late day, is better than middle of the day.  This is a very popular attraction and is very crowded most of the time.  An off-season like a cold wintry day might be the best option if feasible.They have a small cafe, actually two, I believe and plenty of places for kids to get worn out.  Parking doesn't exist right at the Aquarium.  Pier 5 or 6 are probably the most ideal locations.  Parking is expensive, just so you are aware, but there is plenty of it in the downtown Baltimore/Inner Harbor area." "6/13/2015"
"5.0" "When I was a kid, my family and I used to come down from Philly to the harbor aquarium quite often so I was really hoping that it would be as fun and neat as I remembered. And it was, the upkeep has been phenomenal. While some things are obviously dated, the interactive technology upgrades were noted and appreciated. And they've added even more marine life! My favorite part was the jelly fish invasion, my husband and I completely nerded out learning all about the species. And do yourself a favor-pay the extra $5 for the 4d movie experience, it was really cool :)" "12/4/2014"
"5.0" "I have always loved the National Aquarium.  There is so much to do and see that it doesn't matter how often you go, you will always have a fantastic time.  Getting a glimpse of the enormous lagoon style tank is always a thrill--the sharks and rays gliding through the water.   Who can forget the seahorse, the corals and of course, the electric eel!" "1/24/2015"
"4.0" "A definite must stop location if you are in Baltimore.  Located in the Inner Harbor area, close to all the attractions and convenient to water taxis, it is super easy to get to and find.  I haven't been to a ton of aquariums but this was the best by far that I've seen.  Tons of displays and animals and things to see.  Kids would LOVE this place.  If you can manage it, go during a not peak time (we went mid-morning on a week day) as I suspect the place would be crowded on weekends and during the summer when kids are out of school.  When we went, the place was pretty quiet and we were never feeling crowded by anyone or having to wait to see something because there were people int he way.  Very cool place and worth the time and money to check out when you are in Baltimore." "5/19/2015"
"5.0" "Oh man. Whenever someone comes to visit me they always want to come to the Aquarium .. cause that's the most popular touristy thing to do around here right?I do think this is an amazing aquarium BUT the price is incredibly steep. It's ~$40 per person but .. if you love aquariums it's worth it. The design of the aquarium is a one way route and features many lovely sea creatures. The main entrance cuts into a huge coral reef overlook that is perfect for pictures - especially the one finned giant turtle. And maybe you'll be able to see the sloth / monkey that hides in the amazon rain forest - took me 3 times coming here before I found it. If you're like me and have been there too many times to count, try going on Fridays after 5pm. It's half off and a way cheaper alternative than the weekend." "6/3/2015"
"3.0" "Awesome! Spend the extra $5 bucks for the 4D movie it is really cool, my kids LOVED it!" "8/6/2015"
"4.0" "It's a great overall experience, but very crowded. People should learn to watch their kids and teach them manners. The photo sales people should learn to do one transaction at a time so they don't have to get a loss sale for their rude demeanors. Also the big screaming guy as you're entering should learn respect as well, I get it you have to do a crowd control but when I'm already on the wall with my family and he wants me practically kissing it, that's where it starts pissing people off, he also yelled at a mother trying to fix her daughter in a stroller. Just very unprofessional I feel like.Overall it was a good experience, good way to pass time on a boring day. But employees not related to \"aquarium teaching\" need an attitude check!" "4/7/2015"
"4.0" "I'm a sucker for aquariums, zoos...and pet shops (pretty much anywhere I can see animals), so I was pretty thrilled about my visit to the National Aquarium. $35 per adult ticket is steep; I spent a good couple of minutes outside of the aquarium debating whether or not I really wanted/needed to go. In the end, I'm glad I decided to just go for it. It was definitely worth the price. The aquarium boasts such a wide variety of marine life. They have everything from animals found right in Maryland's backyard to colorful creatures from the Amazon. I was a little disappointed that their Jellyfish Invasion exhibit was closed, but there was still so much to see nonetheless. If you're visiting the aquarium in the winter, dress in layers. The Amazonian rainforest exhibit is HOT AND HUMID. I zipped through that exhibit in less than 10 minutes because I felt unbearably hot with all the clothes I was wearing. The aquarium gets crazy crowded on the weekends, so my boyfriend and I waited around to view many of the exhibits. I advise coming as early as possible if you're visiting on a Saturday/Sunday. Also, if that $35 price tag is just too much, there is a special Friday discount. Admission to the aquarium is $12 on Fridays after 5PM!" "1/26/2015"
"4.0" "I have been to the aquarium a handful of times and every time I see something that I'd never noticed before! The Black Tip Reef exhibit is incredible and the attention to detail is unreal. I also love how knowledgable and passionate the staff is about the animals and the facility in general. I have never asked a question and been given a quick answer. Whenever I have visiting family and friends we make a point to stop by and we've always had a great time!" "8/20/2014"
"4.0" "Very nice and clean.  Loved the interactive exhibits.  Also loved the staff that provided information about the different exhibits along the way.  Watched the divers feed the sharks and clean the reefs.  Very cool and loved that it wasn't that crowded." "8/31/2015"
"3.0" "So maybe I'm getting old...I think this was my second visit to the Baltimore National Aquarium. The last time was probably 15 years ago. Maybe more. It's an extraordinary place. Cleverly designed for excellent viewing from a lot of different perspectives. And the tropical rain forest (hope I got that right) in the pyramid glass dome is really extraordinary. And as you make your way through the various exhibits, getting that close to stingrays and sharks without even a shadow of fear... they say they feed them well - Why would they be interested in a gnarly human? - is truly breathtaking.As is the cost of taking a family of five on an outing to see \"things that swim for money.\" Maybe I'm feeling a little self-righteous after reading a couple books about wild things in captivity and the business that's grown up around that. And heaven forbid you stop for a snack at one of the MANY concessions. You're gonna pay to see the fish. There's simply no way around it. But it's a great place. And I'm grateful to those who work there. They seem genuinely invested in making this a meaningful endeavor on every level. Go see the fish! Just check your credit limit first." "1/9/2015"
"4.0" "I've been to the National Aquarium a few times, but this last visit has left me feeling as if I won't be returning for awhile...The aquarium attempts to combat large crowds by selling tickets for a specific time to enter. The problem was that staff were letting people in early. At 1:45, example, they were already letting in people for the 2:00 slot. As it was Memorial Day weekend, it was imperative that staff actually held people back. So, our visit was pretty awful simply due to the large number of people. As with any large crowd, we had to interact with a lot of people who were quite rude and didn't understand that there were space constraints (some people were sitting on the floor in the middle of the dolphin exhibit, other large groups were standing in the middle of the walkways blocking traffic).I must say that it is also very expensive. $80 for two people to visit is pretty steep. And their \"military discount\" that was given to my fiance is quite laughable. $3 off barely does anything since general admission is close to almost $40. While I appreciate that they offer a discount in the first place, I think further could be done to assist active duty members (especially on Memorial Day!). I think I'll save my money for awhile and visit other attractions in the area." "5/23/2015"
"4.0" "In another aquarium review, I mentioned how much I love going to aquariums. In fact, I love them so much I even have a membership to this National Aquarium in Baltimore! The National Aquarium in Baltimore has over 750 species of underwater critters. They have several exhibits: Amazon River Forest, Animal Planet Australia, Atlantic Coral Reef, Atlantic to Pacific, Blacktip Reef, Dolphin Discovery, Jellies Invasion, Maryland Experience, Shark Alley, and Tropical Rain Forest. They also have a 4D Immersion Theater. There are blacktip reef sharks, sea turtles, American bullfrogs, flounders, skates, minnows, eels, giant Pacific octopi, seabirds, Atlantic puffins, two-toed sloths, Emerald tree boas, saltwater crocs, and more. Every day, they have animal encounters, coral reef dives, educator talks, puffin feedings, and other interactive events. My favorite exhibit is probably Dolphin Discovery. The Aquarium currently holds eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and you can catch shows where the trainers train, feed, and interact with them. Admission is $34.95 for adults, $21.95 for kids, and $29.95 for senior citizens. If you want to watch a 4D film, it's $5 per person. You can also become a member for $75/individual, $125/couple, or $175/family. It's a bit pricey for an aquarium, especially given the other bigger aquariums like Georgia (which houses whale sharks!) or the cheaper aquariums like Shedd in Chicago (which has dolphin and beluga whale shows AND California sea lions). The National Aquarium's website has several webcams you can view." "6/24/2014"
"5.0" "Great opportunity for people of all ages to get an up close experience with some of the nations beat animal and aquatic exhibits.Ranging from the simulated rainforrest that housed birds, spiders, monkies, and piranha's, to the coral reef exhibit where one can see the multiple layers of the underwater ecosystem. There is a multifloor shark tank where even the most jaded museum goer can be drawn into the living exhibits.My personal favorite was the jellyfish invasion exhibit that displays a wide variety of different types of jellies. I've always been fascinated by the anomaly that are jelly fish so this small exhibit caught my attention for probably longer than it should. As others have mentioned there is also a dolphin show that runs throughout the day, a 4d movie theater, and an Australian outback exhibit. If you're in the area and looking for a way to kill off a day either with the kids, the family, or even by yourself, I would highly recommend visiting the National Aquarium." "1/22/2015"
"3.0" "This is a must see in the Baltimore area.  My husband and I had come here when we were dating, and we went again last night with our daughter. We had the opportunity to go to the members night, which was awesome because there were no crowds. We can't wait to bring our daughter back when she's older and can have a more interactive experience." "8/20/2015"
"3.0" "It was just okay. Kind of plain and dark. I bought tickets for evening when they were significantly cheaper because 40 a pop plus 24 for parking really puts a hurting on the wallet. No strollers which I didn't know. Carrying around a 6 month old sucked." "7/25/2015"
"5.0" "Great exhibits, however the staff at roll call and entry way are rude and not welcoming. It'll probably be another 5 years before I return." "6/17/2015"
"5.0" "This is a surprisingly spacious and meandering aquarium with a great variety of exhibits. Sure - it gets crowded, and expect loud kids to be pushy, but rather than getting annoyed, just enjoy the fact that kids are that excited about being here.I absolutely love the huge \"reef\" tank - and getting to view it from below, at sea level, and from two and three stories above. Watching the sharks circle from above is second to none. Not to mention how fun it looks to be that giant sea turtle.The jelly fish tanks were not as extensive as some I've seen, but they did have a diverse collection and even dimmed the lights so you can see them light up from the UV lights in the tank.Penguins... YEAH!!!There was also an aviary - which was confusing and hard to find many birds in - but still fun. See if you can find the tarantula while you're in there. Don't worry, he has a glass enclosure hidden away... he usually stays in it.This could be a fun date place, a great place for kids, and even not a bad place to go and just play with a new camera to try to capture images of some of the exhibits. Mostly, it's a top class aquarium, and while a tad pricey ($35 for adults, $22 for children) I can't imagine its cheap to run this place, and proceeds are used for conservation efforts and animal care."

"4.0" "This is truly a MUST stop when in Baltimore.  We had researched locations to visit while in Baltimore and this definitely was one that kept popping up on the radar.  It is ranked in the top 3 and we were definitely not disappointed.  Located in the Inner Harbor and was easy to get to from hotel.  Plan on 3-4 hours to truly experience this Aquarium. The activities are good for kids and adults.  Very educational!  A bit pricey, so be prepared to fork out some money.  AAA card gives discount.  Senior could not use ARAP card...had to be 65."

"4.0" "We had a wonderful time! The aquarium was  located perfectly next to all the inner harbor good eats and bars. I docked a star because I feel like admission ($35ish) was too steep and discounts/coupons/promos are rarely offered according to aquarium patrons. There was an abundance of exhibits and the  setup was very efficient and linear. I wish they had hands on displays like the Monterey bay aquarium. The dolphins out on a great show. I wouldn't buy food from the cafe, it's a little too overpriced. The aquarium seems like a great place to take your kids, the little ones were so interested lol. A definite must see if you are coming to the inner harbor of Baltimore." "7/6/2014"
"3.0" "Great for family trips. Lots of interesting exhibits and the dolphins are always fun to look at, even if they don't do the dolphin show anymore.The rainforest is neat if you have the patience to try to find everything in it. It's really interesting at night - I've been there once at night." "1/1/2015"
"3.0" "What a great respite!  Between our secular and volunteer work, my husband and I are workaholics.  I was determined to do something different this weekend.  We spent the extra $40 to get the behind the scenes guided tour of the black tip reef shark exhibit.  It was well worth it.  If you go, ask for Victoria.  She was super informative and lots of fun!  Our first visit and we spent about four hours there.  I wanted to see the dolphin show but by the time we figured out there were only three dolphins in the tank, I have to admit I was a little disappointed.  By this time I was starting to get HANGRY and didn't see a reason why we should wait around another HOUR to see them jump through hoops!  Overall a very pleasant experience.  My husband who rarely takes time for himself commented several times how much he enjoyed himself and that it was \"such a good suggestion, I'm so glad I thought of it!\"  He thought of it.  Yeah right!"

"4.0" "I love this place.How can you not love this aquarium. It is jam-packed with live specimens abound. It is not often that you find such a cultural treasure in cities these days due to budget cuts and the war on education, so it is truly paramount that if you are in Baltimore that you stop by and experience the little snippets of our world that are stuffed into this wonderful building." "11/24/2014"
"4.0" "This is a great aquarium to check out, and one attraction that is worth to see if you're in the Baltimore area, even for a one-time experience.  The tickets cost you about $35, so it is kind of pricey; however, with school trips, there are discounts available; you can also add upgrades such as a 4D Immersion Film and a Behind-the-Scenes experience.  They have animals from the Amazon River Forest, Australia, the Atlantic Coral Reef, Atlantic/Pacific oceans, from the Blacktip Reef, dolphins, jellyfish, sharks, and creatures from the Tropical Rain Forest.  The aquarium also hosts conservation events and they even host a life aquatic radio show called 'A Blue View.'  I love animals so this aquarium was a real treat! :D  It is located by the Harbour and there is metered parking as well as parking garages around the area.+a great B-more attraction" "3/24/2014"
NA "Probably the greatest and only noteworthy attraction in Baltimore, the National Aquarium doesn't disappoint. It's certainly pricey, but the experience and education is worth it, and there are occasionally special discounts.The National Aquarium hosts features such as shark feeding, dolphin shows, 4D movies, and all sorts of marine life you've never seen. It's cool to see certain creatures of the sea cohabit the waters with each other and the learn about the lesser known species such as jellies and coral." "9/8/2014"
