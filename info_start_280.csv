"4.0" "Fun aquarium- lots to see but was very crowded when we visited. I love the location. The fish were plentiful and the tanks were very nice. The last aquarium I went to was in Atlanta and this was not on the same level. However I did enjoy this visit." "10/22/2013"
"5.0" "Ahhhh... Maryland winter weather seems to have a sense of humor.  This past Friday, it started off grey outside but with a tolerable temp.  Then it started to rain.  Then it stopped.  Then the clouds began to clear bringing with it gale force winds that kept my hands gripped at 10 and 2.  So what better day to head to the aquarium with the munchkin?  Despite the weird weather, I had been wanting to come here for a while and when I read about the great deal they offer on Fridays it was a no brainer.  It was quite crowded but worth it to save a massive amount on the normal admission prices and we even got to see the dolphin show.  I humored my daughter and we sat in the splash zone.  I think she wished we hadn't done that more than I had.  The aquarium is impressive and I loved the jellyfish exhibit.  Gave me some of the best photos I have ever taken."

"3.0" "The National Aquarium is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests because there's so much to see, learn, and explore -- it never gets old. I love to visit with kids to experience the wonder of the animals through their eyes, but even as an adult I find the aquarium enjoyable.One of my favorite experiences at the Aquarium is taking an Immersion Tour. I've taken the shark experience tour, where a guide led my small group behind the scenes to see the food prep areas and the exhibits. I even got to see baby stingrays -- awesome! Next time you're looking for an adventure in Baltimore, make sure the aquarium is on your list." "4/20/2013"
"5.0" "For a \"National\" Aquarium, I think that they really need to step up their game. I look forward to the new Black Tip Reef exhibit, and I hope that they will offer the shark - petting like NJ (Camden) does. Honestly, I didn't find this aquarium very intriguing. None of the exhibits are particularly Awe-inspiring or one of a kind. The dolphins are now an exhibit (No more show) and my kids really love that. They're generally very active and happy looking, I love that we can stand next to the tank and just observe. Also a very important note, they do NOT allow strollers. There is a free stroller check , and a free backpack-carrier thing for toddlers. For a heavy 2 or 3 year old who wants to run amok.. It's back - breaking insanity. For Adults who want to browse, and are interested in Biology , it can be very informative and interesting." "12/2/2012"
"4.0" "As a Chicagoan that's taken his son to the Shedd Aquarium more times than Pamela Anderson has taken nuptials it takes a lot to impress me. I didn't even make it inside four feet before I was awestruck by the three-story Cheasapeake Bay Waterfall habitat. More jaw drops ensued at the new Australian exhibit, which puts you right in the middle of a habitat among high rock cliffs, bats hanging from the ceiling, birds chirping... Plenty of docents to answer your questions, I even heard one leading around some awestruck Aussies- KRIKEY!Next up, or next down the spiraling path is the Rays. Looking down into a pool of about ten different kind of rays with a beautiful sea turtle with one front fin, I kinda freaked out. This part was empty on a rainy Thursday afternoon and my shark phobias kicked in with the trippy underwater soundtrack and \"added\" fish noises. I don't mind music, but adding bumps and gurgles, I could see kids (and fish freakers like me) getting a little spooked. You can also go down a winding path to look beneath the ray and sharks, truly a great positive to the National Aquarium is the unique design.The main aquarium has ped-friendly escalators that guide visitors up through about five stories of traditional aquarium-in-wall displays. Which include short learning facts and \"Seymour Says\" quick bites. Sometimes one sentence written on a Yellow Post-It note stuck right to the face of the aquarium was what got everyone talking!Well worth the money, this is truly a gem to Baltimore's Inner Harbor!" "9/25/2008"
"3.0" "Stunning!  You're gonna pay a decently hefty fee for admission and wait in lines...but it's absolutely worth it!  The exhibits are top notch and offer tons of variety to meet everyone's levels of interest.  If you're taking a few days to visit Inner Harbor, I highly recommend doing this and the Science Center back to back!" "1/5/2011"
"5.0" "My kids love this place! They are both nature and sea animal lovers. We could have stayed all day because the place is pretty large and there's lots of life-sized creatures to see. However, it's not stroller-friendly, and for such a large place, it was quite tiring having to carry my toddler around after the first couple of hours. Better suited to kids who can stand walking around all-day. Admission is a bit expensive to me and you also have to pay to park in the garage." "4/12/2012"
"3.0" "I came here six years ago and remember enjoying my time at the aquarium a whole lot. I was definitely stoked and excited to come back for my weekend in Baltimore. I was with my mom and our close friend and we had a blast. The aquarium is undergoing some changes. They are moving their stingrays to another exhibit from the one that you see when you first enter to one upstairs, I think. Most of their stingrays are being transferred down to the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. Also, dolphin shows no longer seem to be entertainment shows but are now more educational. I think that the aquarium is paying attention to some recent ethics issues around whether or not training dolphins to do things that they wouldn't naturally do in the wild is right. Sadly, they've gotten rid of the seahorses so I am sorry if you like those! :( They used to be in a little circular tank on the ground floor which now contains lionfish, an angelfish, and a pufferfish.  The aquarium has an awesome new jellyfish exhibit and really shows off these most fascinating creatures and being the seemingly otherworldly beings that they are. Luckily we got around to this exhibit right before closing! (which turned out to be an hour earlier than they had said on the website..wasn't too happy about that). There were all kinds of beautiful jellies. The dolphins are great fun and super charming. They are so inquisitive and smart. Prepare to get wet if you're sitting in the splash-zone! There is a nice Amazon rainforest exhibit though I never quite understood why aquariums include these. It's an aquarium not a zoo. The sharks are cool though they only have nurse and lemon sharks mainly. See the puffins!! They love to put on a show for you and are so cute! We came on a Monday afternoon and as we figured, the crowds weren't terrible at all and there was no line to buy tickets which was spot-on. We figured we'd come today after changing our minds about Saturday night when the place is open late. I am sure we would have been trampled by kids, couples, and families then. This is a great aquarium and I still enjoyed myself very much even though they seem to be in a bit of a transition. I will need to hit the one in DC next!" "8/28/2012"
"4.0" "In comparison to the Chicago Shedd Aquarium, eh.....I have seen better. They could use some renovations and some fresh ideas for exhibits, but overall it was nice way to spend a weekend afternoon.  This is still an old school aquarium where it's VERY dark and not a lot of interactive displays.  The walkways are not very wide some sometimes the crowds can be a bit much. The Australian exhibit is newer and more to my liking.  Their exhibit design was much more integrated and made it feel like you are actually in the habitat.  I love how it also included the birds flying above and hearing their calls.  That added a whole different experience to the marine/aquatic exhibit.  I did find that even though it was crowded, it was pretty manageable for gimps in wheel chairs.  Once you knew where all the elevators were it was fairly easy to get around.  On the ramps for the big coral reef tank, make sure you a have a buddy helping you down those ramps or else gravity will get the best of you.The 4D movies are always fun.  But they are very short (like 20 min).  That seems to be the same across most aquariums that I have been to.  4D is not fun for those of you that spook easily or have kids that get scared.  Be prepared to get wet!If you are military, check for your base installation for discounted tickets!" "7/17/2011"
"4.0" "The last time I was at the National Aquarium, I was just a wee little one. I had been wanting to go back for some time, so we finally headed up there on a Friday morning. We figured a Friday morning in early September would be ok since the little kiddies are back in school and certainly shouldn't be taking field trip that early in the year. Low and behold, there were some school groups there, but they weren't too much of a nuisance. We got there just after it opened and it took us about 2 and half hours to get through it. I recall it being slightly larger when I was younger though. It was still fun to see our aquatic friends. We even got to see a morning feeding done by the scuba divers.Overall, it's a nice place to go if you haven't been in awhile, but not a place to go on a regular basis. I recall the aquarium in Camden, NJ being larger,  having cheaper admission and more interactive exhibits." "9/30/2010"
"4.0" "First off, the main building (I think it's the newer one) looks so damn cool from the outside that you can't help but be excited to go in.  Tickets are purchased outside and it's rather confusing when you get inside.  When you walk in there's a members entrance to the left and the regular entrance is on the right.  They snap your picture as soon as you get in, it's a little bewildering, and you can get it when you leave.  The information desk is up on the next level.  It's a weird set-up that causes confusion but once you get past that point and they direct you to where to start it's no problem.  All of the environments they've set up are fantastic.  I can't say enough about the docents/volunteers.  They made some really great exhibits even better.  Well, all except for one that seemed to revel in trying to make us feel stupid.  But, whatevs!  I had a much better time than I expected I would.  It's definitely worth a visit.  Parents should note that you have to check strollers." "3/5/2011"
"4.0" "Of course I'm a fan, it's an aquarium, who isn't?!!  My personal favourites were the shark tank and the feeding of the fish by the divers.  We saw a dolphin show which was 15 minutes and a little disappointing.  THey said the first 4 rows were the 'splash rows' but there was no splashing.It takes a few hours to get round and you'll be tired at the end.The jelly fish part was okay, a little small.However, i loved my time there and would recommend anyone to go.  Just be aware of the times of the talks and displays." "11/4/2012"
"5.0" "Always enjoy the aquarium but it's usually overcrowded on the weekends." "8/9/2012"
"5.0" "One of my favorite aquariums! I like this aquarium and the new one in Atlanta the best. We come here every time we're in B'more. My daughter loved the stingrays, jellyfish, sharks and dolphin show. Like others have said it is pricey." "7/20/2010"
"4.0" "This place is excellent! Would definitely go back! So many exhibits and I think it is brilliant that you have to buy tickets for allotted times so it doesn't get over crowded which at first was annoying but it's actually great. We got there at 1 and bought tickets for 4:30, it was a Saturday." "7/9/2013"
"4.0" "I'm from CA and i was very impressed with the National Aquarium.   To my surprise though they had a few Sloths on site in the Tropical Rain Forest and that literally made the visit just that much better!!" "9/22/2013"
"2.0" "The National Aquarium is a world class aquarium with a five star collection of fish and reptiles; however, it deserves to lose a star for its people handling capacity; even on a slow day, you feel that you are asses and elbows in humanity; it detracts from the exhibits. I have to chalk it up to the layout of the building: it just doesn't flow.As a point of contrast, I would compare it to Ripley s Aquarium of the Smokey's; what Ripley s lacks in educational tools , they more than make up  for in people moving skills." "8/10/2013"
"3.0" "This is a beautiful place. But I can't justify spending thirty dollars for one admission!. That's more than I got charged at the louvre in Paris!. Price aside this is a very well designed place and I enjoyed looking at all the different kinds of fish. The rainforest section was beautiful." "2/23/2011"

"4.0" "I've been to a slew of aquariums - most of the best in the USA at this point, from Monterey Bay to Tampa Bay and New Orleans to Newport to The Shedd - that noted, The National Aquarium in Baltimore is rivaled by only Tampa's as the best Aquarium I've seen.  I have no interest in 4D films and Dolphin shows - been there, done that, so we opted for just the general admission and still managed to spend nearly 4 hours there.  The collection of animals is profound and diverse and exceptionally well organized and presented.Certainly there are a lot of Children here, but by-and-large they were quite well behaved.  Combining the animals and displays with the beauty of the Baltimore Inner Harbor area makes this a must see whether you're in Baltimore full time or just passing through." "5/29/2010"
"4.0" "I didn't remember going to an Aquarium as a little kid, ever! So my sister and I packed up the kids, ages 4, 11 and 15 and headed down to Baltimore for a weekend adventure.  At first I was like \"okay it has fish in it, why is it so great?\"  Boy was I ever so wrong!!! We caught a 3D movie and a dolphin show (which was my favorite part) for about $30. The aquarium is much bigger than I thought it was.  At night, it's really pretty .  It took us about 3 hrs to see the whole place (remember we had a 4 yr old boy with us) and EVERYONE was pleased!" "10/3/2010"
"4.0" "The National Aquarium, located in Baltimore's beautiful Inner Harbor, is a true treasure. Unlike other venues of the sort, this aquarium seems dedicated to educating people rather than just putting on a 'show'. It is not the largest aquarium in the world, so walking it in an afternoon is definitely doable and though it may not house some of the largest and/or rarest species in the world, these creatures of the deep and faraway lands are no less impressive. Oh...and the 4-D movie experience, is an absolute MUST. Just be sure to bring your poncho;) Another bonus..is membership. You can apply the ticket purchase of the day of your visit to a yearly membership (there's a grace period). Membership as I understand it, gets you into the Baltimore and D.C. National Aquarium free for an entire year. There are also discounts for movies, goodies in the gift shops, etc, but... the most important thing is that those funds go to further research of the animals that we come to love and learn about because of places such as The National Aquarium." "7/11/2012"
"4.0" "This was quite an aquarium at the end of a pier (connecting with another pier by a bridge donated by the Baltimore Sun/Times Newpaper?) and have a few neat facts along the ceiling.Tickets are timed and entry can get very very busy - buy ahead if you can, or come very early in the morning when it opens. I knew it'd be a good experience walking in and seeing the waterfall and the trout swimming in big tanks.A bit expensive, but there's quite a bit to see. The dolphin show, and the 4D movie experience started off the day for me.  Wander over to the Australia exhibit that leads into the entry waterfall and above it. Various bird and more in the exhibit. Watch out for the signs - they can point to things like the tarantula hidden to the side, or the birds that fly overhead making noise. There's a few live animal showing up front. Walk past the bubble tubes to the main aquarium, where there's a huge tank for rays and a few turtles and small sharks swimming around. Look up and you'll see a fin whale's skeleton. Up escalators and exhibits around the perimeter and you'll find exhibits all carefully maintained around the edge - there's a lot of exhibits that have small windows and it can be very crowded later in the day. Big crowds mean it goes slowly. At least the progression has only one path.  All the way to the top where you see the Amazon rain forest space and then come down through the spiral walkways through stacked aquariums that the creatures can swim all the way around. Shark tanks are at the very bottom. Plenty of space in the tanks. There were feedings and explanations - like how a giant turtle that lost a fin, a nurse shark with a propeller-scarred fin.Pier 4 is connected to Pier 3 by the over-water bridge, and the dolphin show is indoors - great show, and a lot of fun watching the dolphins interact with people and toys. Lots of great moments there.The new jellyfish exhibit in Pier 4 is nice, too - great place to look at nettles and moon jellyfish and more.  Cafeterias in the main and secondary buildings, plus bathrooms all over.A little expensive, but overall a great experience the first time. I can see bringing people here would be wonderful, if slow and a bit humid.Use the lockers up front  - for $2, you can get a locker and have plenty of space to cram things. No need for a coat - it's quite warm inside.Lines for the dolphin show start to enter 30 min before the show. They get to be very packed!" "4/18/2010"
"3.0" "A pricey, but excellent aquarium. $30 gets you access to everything, which includes the dolphin show and 4D movie.  I recommend that you get this package, since you only save a few dollars ($24 for the aquarium only) by forgoing the shows, and those are the highlights.Get to the shows early so that you can get a good seat. You may also want to ask the friendly/helpful staff about the best seating areas for the shows and when the doors open to start seating.If you don't like the feeling of being a sardine, head over to the aquarium EARLY. The crowds later in the day can make it so that you spend more time waiting to see the displays than actually viewing them. Not to mention the parents who carry the stroller transformed backpacks (all together now: \"Transformers, robots in disguise\") and are oblivious to the consequences when they turn around or walk backwards (\"Transformers, more than meets the eye\" takes on a whole new meaning - it meets A LOT more than just your eye. There's your face, the back of your head, the shoulders, and the list goes on).Almost everything is by escalator, which is probably for efficiency so that there isn't too much congestion and the kids don't get too tired before the day is over. The jellyfish exhibit was cool and the lights and background were strategically placed to make it really easy to see them. However, the exhibit itself was a bit small and there were only a few varieties of jellyfish to see.My favorite was the end of the main exhibit, where you are at the center of a large fish tank. The tank was basically a hollowed out circle and the fish can be observed from the inside and outside. You walk down a ramp, and at every level, you can see the different schools of fish and miniature reef sections. The predators and other fish are separated by a thick plate of glass (almost impossible to see). Overall, the experience is as though you are under the sea and can walk around and observe life at the bottom of the ocean. Of course, if you keep following the school of fish swimming around, you will find yourself walking in circles.There are many helpful volunteers and/or employees who are happy to help explain things.Fun place to go, but the crowds can be daunting." "4/23/2010"
"4.0" "A lot has certainly changed since the last time I was there more than 10 years ago. I miss the outdoor seal exhibit. I also remember the first time I was there, they had a spiral walk-around cylindrical tank I think full of jellyfish at that time.I guess I was expecting the same thing, but this time around it seemed like a rather ordinary aquarium. $25 for admission ain't bad I suppose. The $3 extra for the dolphin show was worth it I guess, but the actual show was a little bit unimpressive.I would not discourage anyone from going. It's totally worth it, but I just can't say I'm a fan, or that'd I'd be eager to do it again...especially when toting around a baby (as strollers are not allowed)." "9/10/2010"
"4.0" "WE joined so we could go again and again.  If you are a family of 5 or more and live within a few hours, it is worth the membership.  Great place to explore for hours.  Great location to leave and come back." "7/15/2013"
"3.0" "We never made it to the $8 Fridays after Five (which sounds a little too much like happy hour at a wine bar), but the National Aquarium in Baltimore served us well over the Charm City years, entertaining out-of-town visitors and getting our fish n' aquatic mammal fixes when the land-locked life got to be too oppressive. This aquarium has a confusing name - deliberately so, I think. It's not part of the Smithsonian museum complex, neither is it run by the federal government. It owes its existence to a 1970s era urban restoration initiative launched by MD mighty politico, William Donald Schaefer, who was mayor, governor, comptroller, and basically every other position of power in the state, save for coach of the Orioles, Ravens, or Terrapins, until he was finally voted out of office in 2007. Schaefer has left his mark, often quite literally, all over the downtown, but the Aquarium may well be his most lasting and lucrative contribution to the Inner Harbor. It is the biggest tourist attraction in Maryland (no Disneyland here), and it now boasts an Amazon rainforest as well as an Australian Outback (a corporate tie-in w/ Animal Planet), although the dolphin show and \"4D\" theater seem to draw the biggest crowds. Personally, my favorite spot is the mutlilevel Atlantic coral reef exhibit, a gigantic and dimly lit tank with a spiral, sloping walkway in the middle that allows visitors to descend to the bottom while watching fish and sharks speed past them at a breakneck, dizzying pace. Things slow down considerably in the \"Wings in the Water\" open tank filled with rays that flap themselves around in endless circles.  While run by a non-profit entity, the NAiB is profit-driven with cafes, gift shops, and high ticket prices. Probably they need to do these things to stay afloat, and they also sponsor conservation and other educational programs. It can't be cheap to maintain such an elaborate setup. But it's still odd to imagine that while the Chesapeake Bay continues to struggle with run-off, algae blooms, and low crab counts, the artificial environments here are alive and well. Maybe attending the NAiB will raise awareness in saving the Bay, but maybe not. Maybe people just want a good show. Dance, dolphin, dance! Smile pretty for the camera ..." "1/4/2010"

"4.0" "Dam if they didn't dig in my dam pockets. Me and the lady took the kids here and did it big lol. We did the whole shebang, 4D movie, dolphin show Jellyfish and all. The kids really enjoyed themselves and continue to talk about it to this day so I guess all the money spent was worth it. My only complaint is they charge to much for the 4D movie only because it was to short. I expected more from the dam dolphin's but that's only because I bought the tickets so I wanted more of everything. If your looking for something to do downtown with or without kids, this wont disappoint." "1/19/2011"
"3.0" "I love aquariums and this is best aquarium in the area.  I've been here when I was a kid but I recently went here with some relatives that were visiting and we spent all day here.  I love that they have a really cool rainforest exhibit.  If you look hard enough you can find their sloth.  We all really enjoyed the dolphin exhibit where the staff talked about their dolphins (I believe one's name is Bo) and had them perform a few tricks.  The shark tank was amazing.  It's a really deep tank and so you walk down this ramp for ever with sharks circling around you. Their jellyfish exhibit was absolutely mesmerizing- I could have stared at them all day.  They, of course, have a lot of other tanks with all sorts of underwater wildlife and so visiting here can take almost all day.  Great place to pass the time if you're in town." "3/9/2013"
"4.0" "An overpriced aquarium full of tourists and unattended children. I couldn't see half of the exhibits up close because of all the people taking pictures of fish with their phones. The dolphins and jellyfish are really the only things worth the time or money." "8/5/2013"
"2.0" "It is a first class Aquarium. However it is expensive and crowed. The Dolphin show was nice but short. There is so much in the way of educational information that it can be overwhelming.  There idea of an animal encounter show was a box turtle, that was a bit disappointing.  The cafes and eating areas are weak at best.  However the place is kept in excellent condition and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  It is about as good as an Aquarium gets.  If not for the cost and the crowds it would have been 5 stars." "7/3/2013"
"4.0" "When I lived in VA I used to go to this aquarium at least once a year. I loved watching the seals outside and walking through what feels like a maze of shark tanks. I have since moved away but visited soon after the renovation was completed. It feels more like a museum now than an aquarium. The building is so big but you wonder where all the animals are- Oh, wait, they're trapped in their tiny, cramped exhibits. Most of the interactive activities that I remembered are gone and the atmosphere is completely different. I would only be willing to pay admission if I was bringing small children with me. Otherwise, it's lost all appeal." "6/28/2010"
"5.0" "A great way to spend a winter day, no strollers so plan ahead! The coat check is 2 bucks and its really crowded on Saturdays. The volunteers make this place special - I've been inspired to volunteer now :) great job National Aquarium!" "2/24/2013"
"5.0" "On a recent trip to Baltimore, we decided to follow-up our visit to the Maryland Science Center to a vist to the Baltimore National Aquarium. Again, we had free tickets, courtesy of our corporate friend :), so I'm not sure if we would have gone to the aquarium if we didn't. The admission price is pretty steep-- adults are $29.95 and kids are $20.95. If we had decided not to spend the money, we'd def be missing out!The National Aquarium at Baltimore was great. We went later in the afternoon and it was pretty crowded. Fortunately, the aquarium is rather large and it was easy to see the exhibits even from afar. I esp loved the Upland Tropical Rain Forest exhibit which was an actual rain forest re-created in a large indoor, greenhouse-like space. As soon as you enter the area, the humidity hits you and feel like you are transported to a different place. Admittedly, it was a bit crowded in there, it was difficult to get close enough to some of the exhibits. A large group of people were clustered in one part of the rain forest exhibit, hoping to get a glimpse of the Golden Lion Tamarin. The huge crowded of people probably scared the poor thing way up into the trees. We never saw it but it was cool knowing that the elusive animal lived there!Shark Alley was equally impressive, with the large glass windows lined up along the tank that houses the different sharks. The large glass windows allow you to get up close to the sharks and can be a bit unnerving. My favorite part of the aquarium was the Dolphin Discovery exhibit. The exhibit features a dolphin show that runs periodically throughout the day. We were lucky enough to be in the area at the start of one of these shows and had our choice of seats. The first 3 rows of seats are in the \"splash zone\" and while we wanted to be close, we didn't want to be THAT close so we opted for seats in the 4th row. If you are expecting a show that rivals the ones seen at Sea World, you will be disappointed. The show is simple but entertaining. It begins with an introduction to all the dolphins-- all Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins-- that live at the National Aquarium. Each dolphin has his/her own \"trick\" that they perform as they are introduced. The trainer then goes over different parts of the dolphins' anatomy and the ways dolphins swim. The final part of the show allows the dolphins to show off their skills like jumps and twists. It was fun to watch and beautiful to see these animals up close. Another area in the exhibit allows you to see into their tank and you can see the dolphins swim around. I saw that the aquarium also offers meet and greets with the dolphins for an additional fee and by appt only. That would be an awesome experience for those who haven't had the opportunity to do it in their natural environment.The National Aquarium, while a bit pricey, is def worth a visit. You can conceivably spend the whole day there watching the different sea animals. I wish there were some hands-on exhibits to help keep the children entertained but that's what science centers are for! I highly recommend the aquarium.. it is on my list of must-sees in Baltimore and so conveniently located at Inner Harbor!" "11/7/2012"

"5.0" "This place is really cool! I love aquariums and this is a great one. Although tickets can be a little on the pricey side, you can go after 5pm on Friday nights and pay a reduced rate. Be forewarned, though, a lot people know about this deal. It can be a little crowded but you still have ample time to see everything. The octopus and sea turtle were my favorite attractions. The aquarium does a great job incorporating educational facts in the exhibits. My only regret was that we didn't see the dolphin show. I think it's included with admission now, so I'll make sure to get to it next time : )" "1/5/2013"

NA "Really stellar aquarium. I've been going here since I was just a tot spending summers with my grandparents. I've been dying to see the Australian build-on since it was added several years ago, and finally found time to do it this Monday.If you're planning to visit, make it a weekday if it all possible. Getting through the ticket line was a breeze, and we didn't have to volley for face time with nearly any of the exhibits. They've made some great updates since I'd last visited -- particularly with the touch-activated signage by the rays exhibit -- you can select the type of fish you're interested in learning about, and hone in on details like size, diet, location, and video footage.I love the layout of this place too -- it's very intuitive; you don't even need to use the map. And it's pretty impossible to miss any exhibits because of this. One of my favorite areas is the spiral ramps that take you down the center of the large tank featuring a few species of sharks among other sealife. So amazing to observe these creatures so up-close. I also particularly enjoyed the temporary exhibit of jellyfish -- great variety, and just beautiful in their movement and colors.The Australian area honestly ended up being a bit of a letdown. It's only two levels, and considerably smaller than I'd anticipated. I couldn't find many of the birds that were posted, and the marine life seemed to be more of the same.I would recommend paying the extra few bucks to upgrade your ticket to include the dolphin show. This is about a 20-minute feature with five bottlenose dolphins that are trained to show off their smarts and agility with tricks and jumps that will be entertaining for both kids and adults. The only reason I can't slap a 5th star on here is because the cost ($25-30 for an adult) really is steep. So much more than going to the zoo (which is pretty equally awesome) back home. If they offered some more interactive opportunities with animal trainers or marine biologists, perhaps it would help boost that value.Plan to spend about 2-3 hours in order to leisurely enjoy everything that's there!"
